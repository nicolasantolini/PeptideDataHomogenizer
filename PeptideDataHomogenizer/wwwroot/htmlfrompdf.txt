Abstract
The human prion protein gene (PRNP) is mapped to the short arm of
chromosome 20 (20pter‐12). Prion disease is associated with mutations in the
prion protein‐encoding gene sequence. Earlier studies found that the mutation
G127V in the PRNP increases protein stability. In contrast, the mutation
E200K, which has the highest mutation rate in the prion protein, causes
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and induces protein aggrega-
tion. We aimed to identify the structural mechanisms of E200k and G127V
mutations causing CJD. We used a variety of bioinformatic algorithms,
including SIFT, PolyPhen, I‐Mutant, PhD‐SNP, and SNP& GO, to predict the
association of the E200K mutation with prion disease. MD simulation is
performed, and graphs for root mean square deviation, root mean square
fluctuation, radius of gyration, DSSP, principal component analysis, porcu-
pine, and free energy landscape are generated to confirm and prove the
stability of the wild‐type and mutant protein structures. The protein is
analyzed for aggregation, and the results indicate more fluctuations in the
protein structure during the simulation owing to the E200K mutation;
however, the G127V mutation makes the protein structure stable against
aggregation during the simulation.

1 | INTRODUCTION
The accumulation of the pathological form of prion
protein in human and animalbrains causes priondiseases.
Evidence suggests that a pathological form of prion
protein is created by the transition of natural prion
protein (with 42% α‐helix)toabnormalprion protein (with
43% β‐sheet) that causes the alpha helix deformed β‐sheet
structure, which is reported in both humans and
animals.1–4 These fatal neurodegenerative maladies
include symptoms such as rapidly developing dementia,
difficulty walking and changes in gait, hallucinations,
muscle stiffness, difficulty speaking, fainting, and finally,
death. Human prion diseases develop in three forms

for about 10%−15% of all human prion disorders, such as
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann–Straussler–
Scheinker syndrome, and fatal‐familial‐insomnia.5,6
The prion protein gene (PRNP) is located on the short
arm of chromosome 20 (20pter‐12), which is known as
PRNP.7 The primary encoded protein by PRNP has 253
amino acids (two structurally separated segments,
including n‐terminal and c‐terminal), while mature prion
protein has only 209 amino acids. The prion protein's
globular domain is located at this protein's carboxyl
terminus. The globular domain has three alpha Helix,
which include amino acid sequences 144−154 (helix 1),
173−194 (helix 2), and 200−228 (helix3), respectively.
This region also contains two parallel short beta
structures containing amino acid sequences 128−131
(β‐sheet 1) and 161−164 (β‐sheet 2). The disulfide bridge
between the cysteine 179 (Cys‐179) and cysteine 214
(Cys‐214) amino acids bind Helix 2 and Helix 3 together.
Two glycosylated areas are located on asparagine 197
(Asn‐197) and asparagine 181 (Asn181).8–12 The spatial
structure of the globular domain of prion protein is
available for testing.
Mutations in the prion protein‐encoding gene region
are responsible for creating the genetic state of the prion
disease. So far, more than 50 pathogenic point mutations
of the PRNP have been identified in connection with a
variety of prion diseases.13–15 Regarding their pathoge-
nicity implications, we can classify the mutations that
occur in the prion protein into two categories: (i) Patho-
genic mutations cause prion diseases in the person
carrying the mutation, such as D178V, E200K, and so
forth.16–19 (ii) Disease‐preventive mutations in the
carrier, such as G127V, M129V, and E219K.13,20–23 A
researcher has reported E200K non‐synonymous single
nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) several times, dem-
onstrating phenotypic effects in CJD.24,25
The E200K mutation was first identified by research-
ers in 1989 and was determined as the dominant
Mendelian causative agent of the prion disease in
1991.26 Although many studies have been done on prion
diseases, the mechanism of underlying prion diseases has
been poorly understood, and there is no cure. The
substitution of glutamate amino acid with lysine amino
acid in codon 200 human prion protein (E200K) with the
highest mutation rates in this position leads to the
development of CJD in humans.14,27 Recent studies
identified that the E200K mutations are most common
in various European countries. E200K is the third most
common genetic mutation identified among Chinese
patients diagnosed with CJD. New mutations of G127V
in Papua New Guinea have been identified as utterly
resistant to prion disorder, although the resistance
mechanism is unknown.20 It is generally accepted that
changes in protein function may be induced by the
occurrence of single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in
the coding region, either directly or by conversion in
protein structure.28,29
These days, computational platforms have become
well‐known for predicting disease‐related nsSNPs
researchers.30–32 In the current research, different
computational servers were performed to comprehend
the substitution of glutamate amino acid with lysine in
codon 200 in PRNP (E200K) protein. A variety of
bioinformatics tools, including Sorting Intolerant from
Tolerant (SIFT),33 Polymorphism Phenotyping (Poly-
Phen),34 I‐Mutant,35 PhD‐SNP,36 and SNP& GO,37 are
used to predict the association of the E200K mutation
with disease. In most research due to prion maladies,
molecular dynamics simulations have been used to
investigate the cause of prion diseases at the molecular
level. This study used a molecular dynamics simulation
approach to find prion protein's structural and functional
changes due to E200K substitution. GROMACS inbuilt
tools like g_rms, g_rmsf, g_gyrate, g_covar, g_anaeig,
and g_sham were applied for protein trajectories atomic
interaction analysis. In the current study, one of the most
deleterious prion protein mutations (E200K) is screened
with various bioinformatics servers and compared with
prion completely resistance mutation (G127V) and
wild type (WT) model of prion protein by molecular
dynamics simulation.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Disease‐associated nsSNP
prediction
The SIFT algorithm was used to evaluate an amino acid
substitution affects protein function based on sequence
homology and the physical properties of amino acids.
SIFT server prediction score equal to or less than 0.05 is
considered deleterious for amino acid substitution. Poly-
Phen is a server that predicts the effect of an amino acid
substitution on the structure and function of a human
protein, damaging nsSNP computed by a position‐specific
independent counts (PSIC) score of more than 0.05.
I‐Mutant server is a technique with the Support Vector
Machines method, and the basis of this tool is protein
stability. For a score less than zero, the nsSNP is
considered harmful. I‐Mutant predicts free energy change
(DDG) based on the difference between unfolding Gibbs
free energy change of mutant and WT proteins. In
addition, we used SNPs&GO and PhD‐SNP to predict
the association of the mutation with prion disease.

In this research, we used SIFT, Polyphen‐2, I‐Mutant 3.0,
SNPs&GO, and PhD‐SNP to analyze E200K, revealing
this mutation's impact on prion illness. First, the
information on human PRNP nsSNP (E200K) as
deleterious nsSNP was collected from published
articles.14,26,38,39 Then the amino acid sequence of the
human prion protein was extracted from the UniProt
database (UniProt ID: P04156). The NMR structure of the
PRNP was obtained from Brookhaven Protein Data Bank
(PDB ID: 1HJM), the NMR structure of the human prion
protein (hPrP) globular domain with residues 121−230 at
Ph 7.0. It has three alpha‐helixes with residues 144−156,
174−194, and 200−228 and a short anti‐parallel β‐sheet
with residues 128−131 and 161−164.12 Then, the SPDB
viewer was used to search for missing atoms and perform
energy minimization. The modifications of the PDB
structure were achieved by Accelrys Discovery Studio
4.140 and Pymol.41 Finally, energetic optimization and
MD simulations were performed by GROMACS v5.42
2.3 | Molecular dynamics simulation
Molecular dynamics simulation for all structures was
done by GROMACS v542 package on running Linux
Ubuntu 16.04 operating system. We used force field
GROMOS96 43a143 for simulation. WT and mutant
proteins were solvated in a cubic box with a dimension
of 52.0A,° including single‐point‐charge water. The
structures were neutralized to create the electrically
neutral simulation system by adding Na+ and Cl− ions at
physiological pH. Energy minimization was performed
for 1000 steps by the steepest descent methods. Then
molecular dynamics simulation was carried out in three
steps containing NVT‐MD (constant number of particles
[N], volume [V], and temperature [T]), NPT‐MD
(constant number of particles [N], pressure [P], and
temperature[T]) for 1000 picoseconds (ps) at 300K and
the final simulation production were carried out at 300k
for 300ns for WT protein, E200K, and G127V models. We
then calculated the comparative analysis of structural
deviations in the WT and mutant structures.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Prediction of association between
E200K mutation and prion disease
This study uses bioinformatics algorithms such as SIFT,
PolyPhen, I‐Mutant, SNP&GO, and PhD‐SNP to under-
stand the association of mutation (E200K) with the
disease. In the first step, the result of the analysis of the
E200K mutation by SIFT server (p=0.01) was predicted
to be deleterious. PolyPhen (PSIC=1) showed its effect
on protein structure and function. Also, the output of the
I‐Mutant server (DGG=−0.28) represented the effect of
the E200K mutation on the protein structure instability
(Table 1). Further, the servers SNP&GO and PhD‐SNP
results revealed the association of E200K mutation to
prion disease (Table 2).
3.2 | Protein data set
The WT PRNP structure was obtained from the protein
data bank (PDB: 1HJM). To better understand the effects
of mutation on protein dynamics, we classified prion
structures into three categories based on secondary
structure, three a‐helix (H1, H2, and H3), two β‐sheets
(S1 and S2), and a disulfide bridge (DB) (Figure 1A). The
cocrystallized water molecules were removed. Using
Swiss PDB Viewer, Discovery Studio, and Pymol, point
mutations are induced at positions 127 and 200 of the
WT human prion protein, with Glycine (G) at location
127 replaced by Valine (V) and Glutamate (E) at position
200 replaced by Lysine (K) (Figure 1B). The interactions
of surrounding residues were checked for each WT and
mutant amino acids with the help of DynaMut server. As
a result, we found that the weak h‐bond proximal
interaction was not formed with R164 in the case
of G127V compared to the G127 prion protein
(Figure 2A,B). An additional hydrophobic proximal
interaction was found in E200K with K204 compared to
E200 prion protein (Figure 2C,B). The interactive colors
are as follows: the h‐bonds in the dark orange, weak/
water‐mediated weak h‐bonds in orange, halogen bonds
in blue, ionic interactions in yellow, aromatic contacts in

3.3 | Molecular dynamics simulation
We performed the molecular dynamics simulation of the
WT and mutant structures containing E200K and G127V
over 300ns to understand the structural dynamics and
stability effect of mutant models on prion protein. The
five factors, containing tolerance index, PSIC score, DDG
value, subPSEC score, and disease‐association study,
confirm the conformational changes in prion protein
residues due to the mutation (E200K), which can change
the functional behavior of protein molecules. The
importance of the resistant effect of G127V mutation
to prion disease and the results obtained in the above
analysis on E200K mutation further motivated us to
monitor the dynamic behavior of wild and mutant
types (E200k and G127V) variants of prion proteins.
Then we performed root mean square deviation
(RMSD), secondary structure (DSSP), root mean
square fluctuation (RMSF), the radius of gyration
(Rg), porcupine plots, and Gibbs' free energy landscape
(FEL) analysis of all the structures (WT, E200K, and
G127V) in the prion protein.
3.4 | RMSD
RMSD values were calculated for three model structures
over 300ns (WT, G127V, and E200K) (Figure 3). The
backbone RMSD value ranged from 0.15 to 0.4nm for all
trajectories. During the first 100ns, the WT model
indicates an increasing trend from 0.15 to 0.38nm.
Suddenly, the RMSD value of WT during the 100−150ns
dropped to 0.16nm, and till the end of the simulation,
the WT model showed a lower RMSD measure as
compared to G127V and E200K structures, respectively.
The G127V model shows an increasing trend from 0.15 to
0.35nm during the first 20ns. After that, till 75ns, the
measure of RMSD decreased slightly to 0.16nm, then the
amount of G127V grew slowly up to 170ns and reached
0.35nm, and till to end of the simulation, RMSD
remained stable in the case of the G127V model. E200K
model demonstrates a rising trend from 0 to 25ns, about
0.2−0.38nm; however, after that, till 75ns, RMSD
decreases to almost 0.22nm. Then RMSD increases to
4nm at 100ns dramatically. According to the RMSD plot,
the E200K model attains the maximum deviation till the
end of the simulation compared to the WT and G127V
structure. RMSD plot demonstrates significant stability
loss in three parts of simulation time, such as 40−50,
90−110, and 140−175ns for the E200K model. The
information obtained from the RMSD plot illustrates that
on an average amount of instability E200K>WT>
G127V, respectively.

all structures is E200K>WT>G127V, respectively. The
highest RMSFs scores were observed in the E200K
structure due to E200k mutation, two peaks remarked
in the β1 and end of helix 2, which localized around the
residues 132−134 and 191−196 (LYS194), respectively.
An unusual peak in the model E200K has been observed
in the β1 region with a value of approximately 0.43nm,
which is correlated with the MET134 amino acid. The
highest fluctuation is remarked in the C‐terminus of
Helix 2, with a maximum value of approximately
0.56nm, which is correlated with the LYS194 amino
acid. G127V as a protective mutation demonstrates less
RMSF than two other structures (E200K, WT) at the end
of Helix 2. The central parts of Helix 2 and Helix 3 show
the lowest RMSF score.
3.6 | Secondary structural
analysis (DSSP)
Secondary structural elements as a function of simula-
tion are shown in Figure 5. It has been observed that the
WT and G127V models follow the same pattern during
the simulation with less fluctuation. However, the G127V
model is more stable than WT during simulation time.
On the other hand, most changes in the secondary
structure of the protein were related to the C‐terminus of

simulation. Although results obtained from the second-
ary structure have depicted fluctuation at the end of helix
2 for all three models (WT, G127V, E200K), the E200K
has shown extensive conversion from helix to turn, bend,
b‐bridge, and β‐sheet that support the RMSF pattern in
Figure 4. The significant variation of the secondary
structure is related to the C‐terminus of Helix‐2 at 50, 100,
150, and 220ns, with variations observed as β‐Sheet and
B‐Bridge for E200K mutant result, in which the peak of
changes is related to 100ns in the c‐terminus of helix2 that
conversion to β‐sheet is seen. In the C‐terminus of Helix‐2,
due to E200K, during the simulation, variations in the form
of the Bend, Turn, B‐bridge, and β‐sheet are always seen,
which is related to amino acids 189−197. During the
simulation, B1 is extended. Changes at the C‐terminus
Helix 3 are visible as Turn and Bend in all three models
(WT, G127V, and E200K). The order of secondary structure
deviation is E200K>WT>G127V, respectively.
3.7 | The Rg
The prion protein compactness was explored with the
help of the Rg factor from GROMACS. Figure 6 shows
the Rg of the protein plot obtained by the g_gyrate tool of
the GROMACS package. On average, the Rg value for all
structures ranged between 1.37 and 1.52nm. The Rg of
native protein primarily decreased from 1.5 to 1.4 until
150ns, but the Rg value increased during the last 100 ns
of the simulation to approximately 1.5nm. The Rg plot
for the E200K structure represents a significant decrease
from 1.52 to 1.37nm from the 25 to 125ns of simulation;
then, the Rg value increases up to 152ns at 170nm. In
the G127V structure, the first 100ns Rg value increased
up to 1.51nm, and this value decreased for this model to
1.38nm during the last 150ns of simulation.
3.8 | Principal component
analysis (PCA)
The first few eigenvectors, or principal components
(PCs), of the structures have been shown to play a key
role in describing overall system motions. The PCA
analysis based on C‐α atoms has been performed to
analyze the collective motion of all models (WT, G127V,
& E200K). As a result, the first 50 eigenvectors of PRNP
models (WT, E200K, G127V) were analyzed and plotted
in Figure 7A. The result shows that G127V is a stable
model compared to WT and E200K models.
We have identified that the first two eigenvectors
provide the most considerable portion of the total
dynamics of the entire system. Hence, only the first
two eigenvectors have been plotted against each other,
with each line representing protein‐associated motions
(Figure 7B). As a consequence of the findings, the E200K
structure shows very stable clustered lines compared to
other models, and The G127V structure demonstrates a

show a more stable structure, whereas more scattered
lines represent the less stable structure.
3.9 | Porcupine analysis
The motion's direction and magnitude, corresponding to
the first two PCs (PC1 and PC2) constructed from 300ns
molecular dynamics simulation, are depicted by the red
conic arrows in Porcupine plots in Figure 8. Overall, the
E200K model shows more motion compared to the WT
and G127V models; furthermore, porcupine plots indi-
cate that G127V has the slightest movement. In this
analysis, most fluctuations in motion are related to the
beginning of the globular domain, the end of β‐sheet 1,
helix two c‐terminal, the part between helix two and
helix three, and the end of helix 3 in model E200K. The
order of the relative amplitude of motion of the Cα
atoms in the three models is E200K>WT>G127V,
respectively.
3.10 | Gibbs' FEL
The FEL framework is one way of describing protein
folding, which is still an open subject in science. FEL can
show a biostructure's global minima energy conformation
(protein). If biostructure has low stability, it can attain
multiple minimum energy clusters. On the other hand, a
strong and stable structure conformation can achieve
almost a single conformation energy cluster.44 GROMACS
inbuilt scripts (g_covar, g_anaeig, and g_sham) were used
to calculate the first two PCs (PC1 and PC2) as reaction
coordinates, resulting in FEL for three models. The basic
function of g_sham is to plot Gibbs FEL by Boltzmann
inverting multidimensional histograms with PC1 and PC2
as input. Figure 9 represents the EFL plot for WT, E200K,
and G127V models. In the FEL plots, Dark violet/blue
regions reflect the energy minima and energetically favored
structural conformation, and red/yellow regions indicate
the unfavorable structural conformation. The shallow and
narrow energy basin indicates the low stability of structural
conformation. According to the FEL plots in Figure 9,
the G127V showed more stability than the WT and
E200K models.

CONCLUSION
SNPs cause more genetic diversity in humans. These
polymorphisms appear in the coding region of the
protein in two forms (types), synonymous SNPs and
nsSNPs. Among these SNPs, nsSNPs cause amino acid
residue change in the protein sequence45,46 and can
cause changes in protein function due to changes in
protein structure and folding.47–49 In silico methods are
researchers' most common approach to gathering infor-
mation about the etiology of prion diseases.50–53 There-
fore, due to the importance of nsSNPs, we used various
prediction methods and algorithms to analyze the E200K
mutation, destabilizing the prion protein. E200K muta-
tion was predicted deleterious by using SIFT, Polyphen,
and I‐Mutant tools, with SIFT score=0.01, PSIC=1.000,
and DDG=−0.28 (Table 1). Moreover, this nsSNP was
predicted disease‐associated by using PhD‐SNP and
SNP&GO servers (Table 2). Molecular dynamics simula-
tion, a powerful computational method, was performed

articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseThe RMSD was computed for all Cα atoms from
starting structures to describe the convergence of the
protein system. RMSD values were plotted for E200K,
G127V, and native structure (Figure 3). As represented
by Yun et al.,54 a larger RMSD is related to less stability;
the highest fluctuation in the RMSD plot is related to the
E200K model is visible with a maximum value of
approximately 0.4nm at almost 100ns. Moreover, the
lowest value is related to the G127V structure, with a
minimum value of approximately 0.15nm at about 75
and 230ns. The RMSF of Cα atoms between the residues
for three structures (E200K, G127V, and WT) was
calculated to detect the effect of mutation on the dynamic
behavior of residues (Figure 4). It is considered that the
maximum value of RMSFs occurs at the end of β‐sheet 1,
helix 2, and Helix 3. So, it can be suggested that these
protein regions have a crucial role in conformational
rearrangements. G127V, as a protective mutation,
demonstrates less RMSF than other structures (E200K
and WT) at the end of Helix2, which can suggest that this
stability is a result of the protective role of this mutation.
However, the lowest RMSFs score is related to the
central parts of Helix 2 and Helix 3, in which there is a
single disulfide bridge between these two helixes
(Cys179–Cys214). Therefore, it may be supposed that
this connection makes the protein more stable in
mentioned areas.9,55–57
Maps of secondary structure changes obtained from
MD simulations are depicted in Figure 5. The most
changes in the secondary structure of the protein are
related to the C‐terminus of Helix 2 and B1‐strand in the
E200K model during the 300ns simulation. The E200K
model has shown extensive conversion from helix to
turn, bend, b‐bridge, and β‐sheet. As a result, we have
observed higher RMSF values in E200K model residues
(Figure 4). Therefore, the loss of stability in the E200K
mutant structure is suggested by the consequence of
protein aggregation in the E200K mutant model. The
graph of Rg for alpha‐carbon of the protein versus time at
300 k is depicted in Figure 6. During the MD simulation,
the Rg value of the G127V structure is found to drop.
In comparison to the G127V model, the E200K and
WT structures show more flexibility. This confirmed our
theory far more. According to the average Rg graph, the
G127V structure was more stable than E200K and the
native model. The outcomes of the PCA, porcupine, and

articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseFEL plots indicated that the E200K model had a
destabilizing impact compared to the WT and G127V
models. According to the porcupine plot, the end of
β‐sheet 1, helix 2, and helix 3 and the portion between helix
2 and 3 exhibits more fluctuation. Furthermore, porcupine
plotsreveal that G127V has the least movement and the EFL
plot indicates higher stability for the G127V structure in
contrast to the WT and E200K models.
The molecular dynamics simulation study on a
normal and mutated E200K protein model demonstrates
that the E200K mutation caused a change in the
secondary structure of the protein. This study's results
indicate that the end of β‐sheet 1, Helix 2, Helix 3, and
the turning region between Helix 2 and Helix 3 can be
proposed as a site for initiating protein alterations to
β‐sheet and aggregation to amyloids. According to the
study on prion protein resistance by G127V mutation
against prion diseases20,58 and the results obtained from
the MD simulation outputs, it can be interpreted that The
G127V mutation prevents structural changes and fluctu-
ations in the suggested amyloid initiation region and
makes these regions more stable against fluctuations and
structural rearrangement.12,59–62 We have analyzed one
of the most deleterious prion protein nsSNP (E200K) with
various bioinformatics servers and also compared our result
with some experimentally reported phenotypic effects of
the E200K nsSNPs. On the other hand, we have performed
a molecular dynamics simulation of the E200K structure,
G127V structure, and native protein structure. Due to
information obtained from the server's screen and molecu-
lar dynamics simulation analyses, it can be understood that
some mutation, such as E200K in the protein sequence, has
a loss of stability effect and cause aggregation in protein
folding. Some rare mutations like G127V make proteins
more stable against disease.
5 | CONCLUSION
Overall, according to the results obtained from the
prediction of servers that the E200K mutation occurs as
a deleterious mutation in the prion protein structure. The
simulation results (RMSD, RMSF, RG, PCA, Porcupine,
FEL, and DSSP) show more fluctuations in the protein
structure during the simulation by the E200K mutation
at the end of β‐sheet 1, Helix 2, Helix 3, and the turning
region between Helix 2−3, and the G127V mutation
makes protein structure stable against aggregation
during the simulation. We propose to perform more
experimental and computational research on deleterious
and resistant mutations to find the mechanism of change
in protein structure and folding by these two mutant
groups (deleterious and resistant).

Abstract
Hydration plays a crucial role in the refolding of intrinsically disordered proteins
into amyloid fibrils; however, the specific interactions between water and protein
that may contribute to this process are still unknown. In our previous studies of
alpha-synuclein (aSyn), we have shown that waters confined in fibril cavities are
stabilizing features of this pathological fold; and that amino acids that hydrogen
bond with these confined waters modulate primary and seeded aggregation. Here,
we extend our aSyn molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with three new poly-
morphs and correlate MD trajectory information with known post-translational
modifications (PTMs) and experimental data. We show that cavity residues are
more evolutionarily conserved than non-cavity residues and are enriched with
PTM sites. As expected, the confinement within hydrophilic cavities results in
more stably hydrated amino acids. Interestingly, cavity PTM sites display the lon-
gest protein-water hydrogen bond lifetimes, three-fold greater than non-PTM
cavity sites. Utilizing the deep mutational screen dataset by Newberry et al. and
the Thioflavin T aggregation review by Pancoe et al. parsed using a fibril cavity/
non-cavity definition, we show that hydrophobic changes to amino acids in cavi-
ties have a larger effect on fitness and aggregation rate than residues outside cav-
ities, supporting our hypothesis that these sites are involved in the inhibition of
aSyn toxic fibrillization. Finally, we expand our study to include analysis of fibril
structures of tau, FUS, TDP-43, prion, and hnRNPA1; all of which contained
hydrated cavities, with tau, FUS, and TDP-43 recapitulating our PTM results in
aSyn fibril cavities.

not limited to Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and prion disease.1–6 Fibrils
from various proteins associated with neurodegeneration have been
found in postmortem brain histological samples and are neurotoxic
when added exogenously in both cell and animal models.7–10 Recent
studies have established the connection between fibril
polymorphism—the variety of conformations that arise from a unique
or similar protein sequence—and pathology.11,12 One example of this
are the unique tau fibril conformations identified from brain samples
from patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, corticobasal
degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and argyrophilic
disease.11
Despite the vast evidence linking amyloid fibrils to pathology, few
studies have characterized the differences and similarities across fibril
structures from different protein sources and diseases using molecular
dynamics (MD). Sawaya et al.'s seminal article reviewed structures
and summarized common amyloid motifs, folding patterns, and pre-
dicted stabilities based on calculated solvation energies from the
structures alone.13 This study shed light on the commonalities
between amyloid folds and the possibility of investigating them using
computational methods. Recently, using MD simulations, we showed
that waters that infiltrate cavities in both the non-amyloid beta com-
ponent (NAC) nanocrystal and Greek-key fold of alpha-synuclein
(aSyn) are highly stabilizing features that play a crucial role in main-
taining the amyloid conformation.14 Furthermore, we demonstrated
this effect in a set of experiments with aSyn fibrils, where we found
that the amino acids that interact with cavity waters (most notably
threonine 72) are capable of eliminating monomer seeding onto wild-
type (WT) fibrils and enhancing primary fibril growth extent when
mutated to more hydrophobic residues.15 Other groups show that a
subset of threonine residues that are located within the cavities of
these fibril structures are actively O-GlcNACylated in the human
brain, suggesting a role of modifying enzymes on the modulation of
aSyn conformation and aggregation propensity. Indeed, the recent
Parkinson's disease familial mutant T72M demonstrates both loss of
post-translational modification (PTM) capability and enhanced aggre-
gation relative to WT aSyn, leading to pathology.16–18 Interestingly,
cavities have been observed in many other amyloid structures (not
just aSyn) and it has been suggested that these are packing defects
that can be alleviated by ligands.13 The presence of PTM sites within
fibril cavities suggests an alternative hypothesis, whereby modifica-
tion of local hydration at cavity sites can lead to the modulation of
conformation, aggregation propensity, and toxicity.
In a seminal paper by Newberry et al.,19 they performed a deep
mutational scan of full-length human aSyn, in which every single
amino acid in the WT sequence was mutated to the other 19 natural
amino acids, revealing the full sequence-fitness landscape of aSyn.
Using an unbiased, model-independent approach, the periodicity in
the sequence-fitness landscape suggested an alpha-helical structure-
fitness relationship.19 The publishing of this thorough dataset
provides the framework for the investigation of alternative structure–
fitness relationships; allowing us to test our hypothesis that cavity
sites are more sensitive to chemical modifications (probed via muta-
genesis) than non-cavity sites.
Using MD simulations of eight aSyn fibril structures and published
datasets, we tested the hypothesis that amino acids in aSyn fibril cavi-
ties are enriched with PTMs and regulate its aggregation and toxicity
profile, where we show that cavities contain functionally relevant
PTM sites such as O-GlcNAc and are more sensitive to hydrophobic
changes that lead to higher toxicity and aggregation rates. We then
simulated five additional neurodegenerative disease-associated pro-
teins and show that the cavity enrichment of PTM extends to other
amyloid fibrils, suggesting a common role of PTMs in highly hydrated
fibril cavity sites. In total, we simulated 20 distinct fibril protofilaments
from six unique proteins (aSyn, tau, FUS, hnRNPA1, TDP-43, and
prion protein)20–35 for a total of 6 μs of all-atom explicitly solvated
simulations.
2 | RESULTS
2.1 | aSyn fibril cavities are present across eight
distinct polymorphs
In our recent paper, we determined the presence of hydrophilic fibril
cavities in the recombinant rod (polymorph 1a, PDB: 6CU7), twister
(polymorph 1b, PDB: 6CU8), and A53T (PDB: 6LRQ) fibril structures,
as well as the brain-derived MSA Type IA and IB polymorphs (PDB:
6XYO).15 Here, we expanded our simulations to three new recombi-
nant aSyn fibril structures: H50Q (PDB: 6PES) and E46K (PDB: 6UFR)
mutant fibrils, and the WT aSyn polymorph 2b (PDB: 6SST). As shown
in Figure 1, we detected hydrophilic cavities in the new aSyn poly-
morphs (Figure 1F–H) as indicated by the volumes in gray, green, and
red, which were identified using the last 25 ns of simulation with the
Analysis of Null Areas (ANA2) package developed by Barletta et al.36
2.2 | Amino acids in fibril cavities of aSyn are
evolutionarily conserved and contain PTM sites
The persistence of these hydrophilic cavities across aSyn fibril poly-
morphs from multiple genotypes (WT, A53T, H50Q, and E46K) sug-
gests that this motif is conserved. Using the ConSurf-DB server37,38
(which determines evolutionary conservation using sequence homo-
logs from several species), we tested this hypothesis by comparing the
degree of evolutionary conservation of amino acids inside and outside
cavities of the eight distinct aSyn fibrils (Figure 2A). The average con-
servation score of amino acids in aSyn cavities is approximately 14%
higher than amino acids outside of cavities (5.6 to 6.4).
Evolutionarily conserved motifs of mammalian proteins have been
shown to contain PTM sites that regulate function and stability, and
are capable of modulating disease phenotypes when mutated.39 Thus,
we proceeded to map known aSyn PTM sites to the resolved residues

cavities are enriched in PTMs. All tabulated PTMs are summarized in
Table T1 in Data S1 and were identified by literature mining of pub-
lished reviews (a list of pathogenic mutations obtained from the NCBI
ClinVar Database and reviews is also included).18,40–49 For each struc-
ture, we calculated the baseline percentage of residues that are PTM
sites, which accounted for 27% of fibril residues. When parsed by
cavity or non-cavity residues, 33% of cavity residues are PTM sites,
whereas only 20% of non-cavity residues are PTM sites (Figure 2B).
Notably, we observe PTMs such as ubiquitination (K43),
O-GlcNAcylation (T54, T59, T64, T72, T81, S87), phosphorylation
(S87), and truncation (K58, V74, K80, G84, A89) in cavity sites.
2.3 | PTM sites within aSyn fibril cavities have the
largest hydrogen bond lifetimes (HBLs) with solvent
waters
One of the most notable PTM sites within aSyn fibril cavities is T72
(present in cavities across all structures except polymorph 2b, PDB:
6sst), which is known to be O-GlcNAcylated by the O-GlcNAc trans-
ferase (OGT) enzyme in vivo. Interestingly, via all-atom MD simula-
tions, we have shown that this site has incredibly long HBLs with
confined solvent waters. Using REMD simulations and free energy
calculations, we have shown that the removal of these waters, which
are co-crystallized and interact with T72 and T75, lead to the de-
stabilization of aSyn's amyloid core.14,15

articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseThis led us to hypothesize that PTM sites within cavities have
longer HBLs than other residues in the fibril structure. First, we calcu-
lated residue-water HBLs for the last 25 ns of each of the triplicate
simulations. As expected, amino acids in cavities have on average
larger HBLs than amino acids outside cavities (Figure 3A), displaying
approximately a four-fold increase in protein-water HBL (from 10 to
38 ps). Interestingly, when we parse amino acids by both cavity and
PTM, we found that PTM sites within cavities have significantly lon-
ger HBLs (>50 ps) than all other residues (Figure 3B). We validated
our previous results on T72 and T75, two sites of O-GlcNAcylation
found in human brains known to inhibit the aggregation propensity of
aSyn in vitro and in primary neuronal cultures.16,17 As mentioned pre-
viously, T72 is also a site of mutation (T72M) linked to Parkinson's dis-
ease.18 In addition, we detected T59 and S87, another two
O-GlcNAcylation sites found in human brain samples and known to
reduce the aggregation capacity of aSyn in vitro.17,50,51 Interestingly,
S87 can alternatively be phosphorylated, and a recent study showed
that modifying this site with either O-GlcNAc or phosphorylation
leads to two unique amyloid conformations, highlighting the impor-
tance of cavity PTM sites in determining the amyloid fold and
stability.52
Since most PTMs occur at hydrophilic amino acids such as threo-
nines, we calculated the average Kyte-Doolittle (KD) hydropathicity of
each cavity and non-cavity group (where hydrophobic >0 and hydro-
philic <0).53 Figure 3C shows that PTM sites in cavities have very simi-
lar average hydropathicities to residues in the other three groups,
suggesting that overall hydropathicity is not the defining characteristic
for this effect.
2.4 | Hydrophobic and not hydrophilic mutations
in aSyn fibril cavities cause enhanced toxicity
Newberry et al. performed an impressive study employing a deep
mutational scan of aSyn in yeast and determined a fitness metric to
quantify aSyn induced toxicity relative to WT for all 19 other amino
acid at each residue position.19 In Newberry's analysis, they utilized
the α-helical structure of aSyn to explore the structure–fitness rela-
tionship, acknowledging that although the α-helical conformation is
the dominant species in the yeast synucleinopathy model, the amyloid
and disordered oligomeric conformations may be present and contrib-
ute to toxicity.19
Using this dataset, we imposed an amyloid fibril structure-fitness
model and compared the effects of mutating amino acids inside and
outside of aSyn's fibril cavities. As shown in Figure 4A,B, we observe a
lower overall relative fitness for mutations at cavity residue sites than
non-cavity sites when mutated to hydrophobic amino acids (W, F, L, I,
V, M, C, A) (Figure 4A,B), supported by an odds ratio of observing lower
fitness of 12 (Figure S1A in Data S1). In contrast, there is an increase
in fitness relative to WT when sites are mutated to polar residues (Y, G,
S, T, N, Q, H, R, K, D, E) for both cavity and non-cavity residues, with
no difference observed between the two groups.

iley Online Library for rules of use; OA
articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseAs an important comparison to understand the relevance of cavi-
ties to the overall structure–fitness relationship, we calculated and
compared the fitness of NAC and non-NAC amino acids. The NAC
domain (residues 61–95)54 has a high degree of overlap with cavities
and is known to be sufficient for robust aSyn aggregation and
toxicity,55 making it a useful reference scale to explore our hypothe-
sis. When we group residues by non-NAC and NAC, no statistical dif-
ference for either hydrophobic or polar mutations (Figure 4C,D) was
observed. However, we found an odds ratio of 3 of observing lower
fitness in NAC residues relative to non-NAC, further confirming the
known importance of this domain (Figure S1A in Data S1).
Despite the overlap between cavity and the NAC residues, we
observed a four-fold higher odds ratio of observing low fitness upon
hydrophobic mutations in cavity/non-cavity amino acids relative to
NAC/non-NAC (12 vs. 3), suggesting a unique contribution of spe-
cific amino acids that localize to cavities. In fact, when we compare
the fitness of cavity unique (n = 9), NAC unique (n = 8), and cavity/
NAC overlapping (n = 27) residues, we observe that cavity unique
and cavity/NAC overlapping residues have lower average fitness rela-
tive to NAC unique residues (Figure S2 in Data S1). Interestingly, the
residues with lowest fitness in the cavity unique group are K43 and
T54, known to undergo ubiquitination and O-GlcNAcylation, respec-
tively; and G51, known to be mutated to G51D in Parkinson's dis-
ease.40,48 These results suggest that, similar to the NAC domain, aSyn
fibril cavities are relevant structural motifs that contribute to toxicity.
2.5 | Mutations within aSyn fibril cavities are more
sensitive to increases in hydrophobicity
We then grouped all residues that were defined as cavity in at least
one of the eight aSyn fibril structures and performed a global linear
regression of KD hydropathicity versus fitness. Figure 5A shows that
amino acids in cavities have a stronger negative correlation between
KD hydropathicity and fitness. Across the hydropathicity scale, mutat-
ing an amino acid in a cavity results in a greater reduction in fitness
relative to similar mutations in non-cavity residues. In addition, the
hydrophobicity threshold at which a mutation becomes more toxic
than WT aSyn is lower for cavity residues compared to non-cavity
residues (x-intercept for cavity regression is roughly 2 compared to
4.2 for non-cavity). This result agrees with the observed increase in
HBL for PTM sites within cavities; and supports our hypothesis that
amino acids in fibril cavities are regulatory of the toxic fibrillization of
aSyn potentially via hydration and steric effects.
Recently, Pancoe et al. summarized the Thioflavin T aggregation
rate of all published aSyn mutations (both familial and artificial) as of
2022.50 Mutants were scored on a discrete scale ranging from 2 to
+1 where increasing scores correspond to faster aggregation rates
relative to WT aSyn. Using this dataset, we determined the correlation
between KD hydropathicity and aggregation rate for both cavity and
non-cavity site aSyn mutants. Figure 5B shows that amino acids in
cavities have a positive correlation between hydropathicity and aggre-
gation rate. In contrast, amino acids outside cavities have a slope close
to zero. It is important to note that the number of mutants reported
by Pancoe et al. is far less than those in the Newberry et al. dataset—
only covering 5% of the mutational landscape for aSyn—resulting in
the increased 95% confidence interval for the aggregation global lin-
ear regression. Figure S3 in Data S1 provides the distributions of
mutations by amino acid type included in the toxicity and aggregation
linear regressions presented in Figure 5A,B.
2.6 | Cavities with PTM sites are present in other
neurodegenerative disease-related amyloid fibrils
Our findings with aSyn led us to investigate whether these features
are present in other amyloidogenic proteins associated with

12 structures from the neurodegeneration-related proteins tau, prion,
FUS, TDP-43, and hnRNPA1. All of these proteins contain hydrophilic
cavities of varying sizes that possess either PTMs or disease-
associated familial mutation (FM) sites (Figure 6A–E and Figure S4 in
Data S1). Three of the five additional proteins (tau, FUS, and TDP-43)
contained PTM sites within the identified cavities. For both FUS and
TDP-43, the average HBL of cavity residue PTM sites were
comparable to the average HBL of PTM sites in aSyn fibril cavities
(Figure 6F). In contrast, tau cavity PTM sites had a lower average HBL
than what was observed in aSyn, but still much larger than water–
water HBLs (2 ps). Full cataloguing of the PTM sites, FM sites and
fibril cavity properties (e.g., volumes, average KD hydropathicity, aver-
age number of hbonds, average HBLs, and amino acid content) is

methylation site K267 and caspase-2 proteolytic cleavage site D314
have stable HBLs with water. Cleavage at D314 by caspase-2 has
been shown to yield a tau fragment that resists fibrillation and misdi-
rects tau toward dendritic spines causing memory deficits and neu-
rodegeneration in mice.56 Methylation at K267 has been reported to
be present in paired helical filament isolates from Alzheimer's dis-
ease (AD) brains using both mass spectrometry and immunohisto-
chemistry on hippocampal AD brain sections.57 Phosphorylation at
T263 has been not studied extensively, but it has been detected in
seeding competent tau aggregates isolated from AD brains, and it is
commonly found to be phosphorylated concomitantly with S262, a
well-defined site that decreases binding affinity to microtubules
upon modification.58 Phosphorylation at S356 leads to a decrease in
the Thioflavin S positive aggregation of tau and is also implicated in
the early onset frontotemporal dementia FM S356T.59–61 Phosphor-
ylation at T361 has been detected in postmortem AD brains and is
modified by casein kinase 1 lambda (CK1δ), which is elevated in AD
patients.62,63
In FUS, we observe elevated HBLs at S57, S127, and S135, three
known sites of phosphorylation, which have been shown to increase
the liquidity of FUS condensates and prevent the formation of irre-
versible aggregates.41,64–66 In addition, S57 and S135 are sites of ALS
FMs (S135G and S57del), two modifications that eliminate the phos-
phorylation sites.67,68 Finally, we observe a single PTM site with long
HBL inside the TDP-43 fibril cavities, which corresponds to S409, a
site of phosphorylation in the C-terminus of the protein. Modification
at this site has been shown to be increased in pathological TDP-43
inclusions in brain tissue samples of patients with FTD, ALS, and other
neurodegenerative diseases.69
3 | DISCUSSION
This study builds upon our previous work with aSyn and identifies a
relationship between PTMs and aSyn fibril cavity amino acids. We
show that aSyn fibril cavities are hydrated with confined waters and
that changing these sites to hydrophobic amino acids which eliminate
potential PTMs and reduce hbond propensity results in higher toxicity
and aggregation rate relative to similar changes to residues outside
cavities. It is important to note that waters within hydrophilic cavities
experience elevated HBLs due to confinement. However, at the sites
of cavity PTMs we observed even higher HBLs, suggesting that
changes in the solvation of these residues will have a larger contribu-
tion to fibril stability.
Our analysis from simulations of FUS, TDP-43, and tau fibrils sug-
gest that this phenomenon may extend to other neurodegenerative
disease associated proteins, as we revealed at least one PTM site with
exceptional solvent hbonding properties within the cavities of each
one of these amyloids. Although we did not observe PTM sites in the
fibril cavities of prion and hnRNPA1, the presence of FM sites sup-
ports the hypothesis that cavity amino acids influence the stability
and toxicity of amyloidogenic proteins. Our results warrant future
in vitro and in cellulo experimental studies to validate the relevance of
the identified PTM sites within hydrophilic cavities.
The results here support our hypothesis that cavities in disease-
associated fibrils of aSyn are locations where PTMs are capable of
inhibiting the fibrillization cascade and are conserved to reduce the
possibility of toxic protein aggregation. In the cell, aSyn adopts multi-
ple conformations depending on function (e.g., alpha-helix classically
associated with membrane binding) or pathology (e.g., oligomers and
fibrils associated with misfolding). As shown by Newberry et al.,19
mutants that modulate aSyn's toxicity under the alpha-helix structure-
fitness model may correspond to loss of native function; whereas
those that modulate toxicity under a fibril structure-fitness model
could represent a gain of toxic function. The crossover between these
two models may inform on residues that are relevant to both loss and
gain of function events and should be conserved at all costs.
For example, a fibril cavity residue that is also solvated in the alpha-
helix (e.g., T72) likely plays an essential role in regulating aSyn's
conformational state, whereby deviation from WT (e.g., T72M or
T72-O-GlcNAc) can bias toward toxic or non-toxic ensembles.
From a disease etiology standpoint, it will be crucial to study
whether the disruption of PTM enzymes or their regulatory pathways
are dysfunctional upstream of protein aggregation. From a therapeutic
standpoint, these results could be leveraged to rationally activate or
inhibit PTM enzymes with small molecules as to globally modulate the
modification of amyloid-forming proteins. Tools such as proximity-
directed engineered PTM enzymes could be employed to modify sites
predicted to have high water hbonding activity with bulky hydrophilic
modifications as to efficiently block aggregation and evade functional
monomer conversion to toxic oligomers and fibrils. Proximity directed
modification has been successfully utilized to introduce highly polar
O-GlcNAc modifications to aSyn in cellulo in a specific manner by
tethering the OGT to a C-terminal aSyn-specific nanobody.70 Alterna-
tively, small molecules or peptides modified with proteasomal,
chaperone-mediated autophagy, or PROTAC signals could be
designed to initially engage fibrils by binding to solvent accessible cav-
ities, and subsequently directing aggregates to protein clearance
pathways.
Although we only focused on neurodegeneration-related pro-
teins, preliminary inspection of fibril structures of proteins associated
with non-neurological disorders, such as transthyretin (ATTR amyloid-
osis), lambda light chain 1 (AL amyloidosis), and serum amyloid A pro-
tein (AA amyloidosis),71–74 suggest that these cavities may be a
common feature of fibril structures—independent of source protein,
sequence, tissue type, or associated disease.

TIP3P water with a final concentration of 150 mM NaCl, which
includes counter-ions for charge neutralization.
Each system was energy minimized and equilibrated via sequen-
tial 0.1 ns minimizations with fixed backbone constraints, followed by
a 0.1 ns of NVT ensemble run, 0.5 ns harmonic constraint applied to
backbone atoms, 0.2 ns harmonic constraint release, and a 1.0 ns NPT
equilibration run. All simulations were conducted in triplicate with ran-
dom initial velocities seeded from a Maxwell distribution at 310 K and
simulated for a production run of 100 ns with a 1 fs time step. A full
detail of protein, PDB entry, origin (recombinant vs. brain derived),
genotype (wildtype vs. mutant), fibril formation conditions, structure
determination method, and resolved residues for each protein is pre-
sented in Table T3 in Data S1. Upon completion, trajectories were re-
centered and checked for the absence of self-interactions across the
periodic boundary. In addition, root mean squared deviation (RMSD)
convergence was verified, (shown in Figure S7 in Data S1). Global and
per residue RMSDs were calculated in VMD using the original 10mer
structure as reference.
4.2 | Cavity amino acid detection, volume, KD
hydropathicity, hbonds, and RMSD
Fibril cavities were detected using the Analysis of Null Areas 2's
(ANA2)36 pocket discovery feature on the last 25 ns of simulation
which we then used to build the cavity amino acid content heatmap
shown in Figure S5A and Table T2 in Data S1. Using the detected cav-
ity residues, ANA2 was used to calculate volumes by sampling five
equally spaced timepoints of the last 25 ns production run (75–
100 ns of simulation) in triplicate.
Average cavity RMSD was calculated by averaging the per resi-
due RMSD of lining amino acids in a given cavity. Similarly, average
KD hydropathicity cavity scores were calculated by averaging the KD
hydropathicity of lining residues in a given cavity.
4.3 | Hydrogen bond analysis
Cavity hydrogen bond counts were calculated using the VMD Hydro-
gen Bonds tool by selecting waters within 5 Å of cavity residues and
counting the number of unique hbonds between water and residues
with distance and angle cutoffs of 3 Å and 30. Average cavity hbonds
were calculated by averaging the hbond contribution from each cavity
residue. For hbond counting we sampled the last 25 ns production
runs every 0.2 ns for a total of 125 frames analyzed per simulation
replicate.
HBLs between residues and solvent water molecules were calcu-
lated in MDAnalysis as previously described.15,78 Briefly, we used a
water sphere of 5 Å around each residue as the cutoff for water–
residue interactions. We calculated time autocorrelations for residue–
water hbonds using a 30 ps sliding window across the entire last
25 ns production run and recovered HBLs using Equations (1)–(3) in
MATLAB. Cavity HBLs were calculated by averaging HBLs from cavity
residues.

4.4 | Evolutionary conservation scoring using
ConSurf-DB
Conservation scores for resolved amino acids in fibril structures were
obtained using ConSurf-DB.37,38 Briefly, ConSurf-DB utilizes pub-
lished homolog sequences to build a phylogenetic tree that is used to
estimate the evolutionary rates at protein sites (considering both nat-
ural substitution rates for amino acids and the phylogenetic tree
branch length between species). These rates are mapped into discrete
conservation scores (1–9) that reflect the rate of substitutions per site
per evolutionary time, with low conservation scores being the most
variable sites and vice versa.
4.5 | Newberry et al. aSyn deep mutational scan in
yeast data mining
We downloaded the deep mutational scan fitness data published in
Newberry et al.,19 and calculated average fitness scores for hydropho-
bic (W, F, L, I, V, M, C, A) and polar (Y, G, S, T, N, Q, H, R, K, D, E)
mutations at cavity and non-cavity sites. In our analysis for
Figure 4A,B, we included tyrosine as part of polar residues due to the
hydroxyl group that readily hbonds with solvent waters (tyrosine was
counted as a hydrophobic residue in Newberry et al.19). Furthermore,
we excluded proline from hydrophobic and polar definitions as done
by the authors of the original paper. For the linear regression analysis,
we correlated the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathicity scores of the
20 amino acids relative to their average fitness across non-cavity and
cavity residues using GraphPad Prism 9.
4.6 | Pancoe et al. aSyn mutant aggregation rate
data mining
Aggregation rate scores of mutations at cavity and non-cavity amino
acids (as assigned by Pancoe et al.50) were correlated to KD hydro-
pathicity by fitting a linear regression model in GraphPad Prism 9.

Conservation scores and PTM enrichment in fibril cavities were
tested using paired Student t tests. Global HBL comparison between
cavity and non-cavity residues was tested using an unpaired 2-tailed
Student t test. HBL and KD hydropathicity comparison between cav-
ity PTM sites to other residues in the structures was tested with a
one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction for multiple
testing. Newberry et al.19 fitness data comparisons (both cavity/
non-cavity and NAC/non-NAC groupings) were conducted with
2-tailed unpaired Student t tests. Statistical significance for variance
differences in fibril cavity properties grouped by protein type in
Figure S3 in Data S1 were analyzed by conducting one-way
ANOVAs.
Additionally, we calculated odds and likelihood ratios with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for the key findings shown in Figures 2A,-
B, 3A,B, and 4A,C, and referenced the results in corresponding fig-
ure captions. We parsed the data by non-cavity/cavity
(Figures 2A,B, 3A, and 4A) or NAC/non-NAC (Figure 4C) and
dichotomized properties of interest (low/high evolutionary conser-
vation, PTM site count, low/high HBLs, and low/high fitness).
Dichotomization was conducted by calculating global averages for
conservation scores, HBLs, and fitness, which were then used to
parse residues into low (<global average) and high (>global average)
groups.

ABSTRACT: Proteins with prion-like domains (PLDs) are
involved in neurodegeneration-associated aggregation and are
prevalent in liquid-like membrane-less organelles. These PLDs
contain amyloidogenic stretches but can maintain dynamic
disordered conformations, even in the condensed phase. However,
the molecular mechanism underlying such intricate conformational
properties of PLDs remains elusive. Here we employed molecular
dynamics simulations to investigate the conformational properties
of a prototypical PLD system (i.e., FUS PLD). According to our
simulation results, PLD adopts a wet collapsed conformation,
wherein most residues maintain sufficient hydration with the
abundance of internal water. These internal water molecules can
rapidly exchange between the protein interior and the bulk,
enabling intensive coupling of the entire protein with its hydration environment. The dynamic exchange of water molecules is
intimately correlated to the overall conformational fluctuations of PLD. Furthermore, the abundance of dynamic internal water
suppresses the formation of aggregation-prone ordered structures. These results collectively elucidate the crucial role of internal
water in sustaining the dynamic disordered conformation of the PLD and inhibiting its aggregation propensity.
M
any neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, involve
the misfolding and amyloid aggregation of specific proteins
including FUS,1 hnRNPA1,2 and TIA-1.3 These disease-
associated proteins commonly contain a prion-like domain
(PLD), i.e., a low sequence complexity with a similar
composition to yeast prion domains.4,5 The structures of
PLDs are intrinsically disordered and contain amyloidogenic
stretches.6 Interestingly, most of the proteins with PLDs are
also prevalent in liquid-like membrane-less organelles
(MLOs).7−10 The PLDs could mediate reversible interactions
between proteins, driving the formation of MLOs through
liquid−liquid phase separation (LLPS).7,11,12 Numerous
studies have observed that the aggregation propensities for
these PLDs could be well inhibited under physiological
conditions while being promoted by pathogenic factors such
as disease-associated mutations.13−15
The N-terminal region of FUS protein (1−165) is a typical
PLD, extensively utilized as a prototype for elucidating the
principles underlying physiological condensation and patho-
logical aggregation.16−19 It has been reported that FUS PLD
could maintain highly disordered conformations and exhibit
considerable conformational fluctuations even in the con-
densed phase.20−22 Such dynamic disordered conformations
can enable the reversible association between proteins.23,24
Sustaining the dynamic disordered conformations is indis-
pensable for inhibiting its irreversible aggregation and
maintaining the liquid-like properties of condensates.23−26
On the other hand, many disease-associated mutations in FUS
PLD are observed to promote dynamic disordered con-
formations misfolding into pathological aggregates.15,27 How-
ever, the mechanisms by which wild-type FUS PLD maintains
dynamic disordered conformations and inhibits protein
aggregation remain elusive. The comprehensive studies on its
intricate conformational properties are thus crucial for
understanding PLDs’ physiological condensation and patho-
logical mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases.
It is well established that the structures and dynamics of
proteins are influenced by their hydration water.28,29 As
disordered proteins rich in polar residues, PLDs have been
reported to bind more water,30 which implies profound
coupling between PLDs and their hydration environments.
Notably, recent studies have shown that FUS PLD is still
strongly hydrated in the condensates.21,31 These water
molecules constitute ∼65% of the volume of the conden-
sates,21 and they also exhibit picosecond hydrogen-bond (H-

reduction of water contents within the condensates facilitates
the protein aggregation.24,33,34 These facts imply that hydration
water might exert a significant influence on the conformational
properties of PLD, especially its aggregation propensity within
the condensates.
Despite these progresses, the molecular-level descriptions of
PLD and its hydration properties are still largely lacking. In this
paper, we employed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations to investigate the conformational properties of
FUS PLD and the effects of its hydration properties. We
demonstrated that FUS PLD adopts a wet collapsed
conformation that contains abundant water molecules. These
internal hydration water molecules are widely distributed
within the conformation and are well-mixed with the residues.
The internal water molecules remain highly mobile and can
rapidly exchange between the protein interior and the bulk.
Therefore, there is an intensive coupling of the entire protein
with its hydration environment. The dynamic exchange of
water molecules is intimately correlated with the overall
conformational fluctuations of FUS PLD. Moreover, the
abundance of dynamic internal water leads to a high dielectric
environment within the protein and suppresses the formation
of aggregation-prone ordered structures. In short, our study

The state-of-the-art Amber ff99SB-disp (a99SB-disp) force
field was adopted for simulations,35 which is of adequate
accuracy to produce conformation ensembles of intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs) and is in good agreement with
experimental data.36−38 Six independent simulations were
performed for the protein with cumulative simulation times of

Figure 1a shows the contents of each type of secondary

highly disordered, including 59.2% coils, 25.6% bends, and
9.0% turns. Its ordered secondary structures (i.e., β-structures
and helices) are very limited (6.2% in total). The radius of

8317an average value of 1.79 nm (Figure 1b), which is more
swollen than the folded proteins with similar sequence
length.39,40 For example, the Rg of human cyclophilin protein
(PDB ID: 1OCA, 165 residues) is only 1.42 nm. On the other
hand, the conformation of FUS PLD appears considerably
compact compared to coil-like disordered proteins.41−44 And
the Rg of coil-like LAF-1 RGG with 168 residues is as high as
3.55 nm.44 The internal scaling profile (⟨Rij⟩) of FUS PLD was
further calculated (Figure 1b, inset figure).45,46 Its ⟨Rij⟩ curve is
distinct from the Flory random coil (gray solid line) and shows
plateauing behavior (red line). The plateauing behavior of ⟨Rij⟩
indicated that FUS PLD should be modeled as the equilibrium
globule with chain entanglement.47,48 A representative
conformation of FUS PLD is displayed in Figure 1c. It is
noteworthy that a single-molecule FRET study also suggested
that FUS PLD adopts a disordered collapsed conformation in
which the chain is entangled.17 In short, the conformation of
FUS PLD can be considered as the disordered collapsed
globule.
We further analyzed the residue−residue contacts of FUS
PLD (under the contact definition of a 3.5 Å atomic distance).
As shown in the representative conformation (Figure 1c),
there are abundant residue−residue contacts within the
conformation (yellow dashed lines). On average, each residue
is in contact with 4.1 ± 1.4 residues (excluding the sequence-
neighboring residues). In fact, aside from a few residues at the
termini, most residues have over 2 contacts with other residues
(Figure 1d). It is worth noting that there exist residues with
extensive residue−residue contacts (>5), which are essential
for FUS PLD to maintain its collapsed conformation rather
than random coil. These residues are mainly tyrosine (TYR)
and glutamine (GLN) residues (Figure 1d, green solid
squares); both are enriched in the FUS PLD sequence
(14.5% for TYR and 22.4% for GLN). Our simulation results
are consistent with previous experiments, which also suggest
that these residues mediate abundant residue−residue
interactions.21,49−51
On the other hand, the residue−residue contacts of FUS
PLD are rather dynamic. The duration of contacts between
residues is at most a few nanoseconds, and the average contact
lifetime is 1.24 ns (Figure 1e). The time autocorrelation
function of Rg was also calculated. The decorrelation time of Rg
is ∼66 ns (Figure S2): the collapsed conformation still
undergoes rapid chain motions. Moreover, conformational
dynamics of FUS PLD were analyzed based on the mean-
squared displacement (MSD) which is conventionally used to
depict the conformation changes of protein.52−54 We
performed pairwise alignment for two conformations with a
lag time τ (i.e., removing translation and the rotation of the
entire protein) and then calculated the averaged MSD
(⟨Δr2(τ)⟩) for their heavy atoms (see the Supporting
Information for details). The Rg
2 was adopted as the
characteristic length (∼3.2 nm2) to estimate the characteristic
time scale of conformation rearrangement, i.e., the time scale
for protein heavy atoms to experience positional deviations
comparable to the size of the protein. As shown in Figure 1f,
the ⟨Δr2(τ)⟩ curve can increase to the value of Rg
2 within
∼600 ns (gray lines). In other words, the collapsed
conformation can undergo large conformational rearrange-
ments throughout hundreds of nanoseconds. Taken together,
FUS PLD maintains highly conformational disorder and
overall conformational dynamics.
The hydration properties of the collapsed conformation of
FUS PLD were then comprehensively analyzed. Figure 2a
shows a representative snapshot of the hydration environment
around FUS PLD. Notably, there are numerous water
molecules permeating the protein interior (red balls), in
addition to conventional hydration water bound to the external
surface of the protein (gray balls). As shown in the zoomed-in
view of Figure 2a, a deep cleft formed by entangled peptide
segments is sufficiently hydrated by water molecules. In this
Letter, we denoted the hydration water that permeates into
structural voids within the protein as internal water (Figure 2b
red circles) and the other hydration water within the hydration
environment as external hydration water (Figure 2b gray
circles). The workflow of the procedure to identify internal
water is elaborated in the Supporting Information (Figure S3
and Figure S4) and briefly described as follows. At first, the
protein and its surrounding water molecules are selected as the
initial structure (i.e., a protein−water complex). The relative
accessible surface areas (RSAs) for the water molecules of this
protein−water complex are then calculated. The water
molecules directly exposed on the surface of the complex
(RSA > 0.2)55 are removed, yielding an updated complex. This
process is iterated until no more water molecules are removed
from the protein−water complex. The remaining water
molecules in the converged complex are identified as internal
water, which is essentially enclosed within the solvent-
accessible surface of the protein (Figure 2c).
Figure 2d shows the number distribution of internal water
molecules of FUS PLD. There are 130 ± 22 internal water
molecules within the protein, which is close to its number of
residues (165 residues). This is over an order of magnitude
higher than the number of water molecules confined inside
folded proteins.56,57 It is noteworthy that internal water tends
to hydrate multiple residues, distinct from the limited
hydrating capacity of external hydration water (Figure 2e).
Each internal water molecule hydrates ∼4.2 residues, which is
significantly higher than that of external hydration water
(∼1.7). Furthermore, the internal water molecules are widely
distributed within the protein and could hydrate ∼85% of the
residues on average (Figure S5a). Despite considerable
residue−residue contacts, the dry interior regions that exclude
internal water rarely appear within the protein. In other words,
FUS PLD adopts the wet collapsed conformation in which
residues are well-mixed with internal water.
The internal water of FUS PLD forms sufficient hydrogen
bonds (H-bonds) with both the surrounding water and
residues (Figure 2g). On average, each internal water forms
3.50 H-bonds, which is close to the H-bond number of bulk
water (3.65). Among them, there are 2.17 hydrogen bonds
between internal water and the surrounding water molecules
(Figure 2f). Many internal water molecules are organized into
several sizable clusters through the water−water H-bonds, and
the water molecules in the clusters comprise an average of 62%
of the internal water molecules (Figure S5b). In other words,
the internal water can be connected by water−water H-bonds
and form H-bond networks within FUS PLD. Each internal
water also forms 1.33 H-bonds with residues (Figure 2f). Over
40% of the internal water can form H-bonds with multiple
residues simultaneously (Figure S5c). This is in contrast to the
water-residue H-bonds in the conventional external hydration
layer (Figure S5d). Each external hydration water of FUS PLD
forms only 0.37 H-bonds with residues (Figure 2f).

8318Intriguingly, the internal water of FUS PLD tends to adopt
the H-bond arrangement resembling the bulk water (Figure
2g). The tetrahedral order parameter (qtet) was calculated to
quantify the local H-bond structure of the internal water. For a
regular tetrahedral structure, qtet is near 1. In order to
comprehensively depict the H-bond network of internal water,
its four nearest heavy atoms that are able to form H-bonds
were identified, i.e., the water oxygen atoms and the protein
polar heavy atoms (i.e., nitrogen and oxygen). As shown in
Figure 2h, a significant fraction of internal water maintains the
tetrahedral-like H-bond structures with large qtet values (>0.7).
The average qtet of the internal water is 0.61, close to the value
of the bulk water (qtet = 0.66). Besides, the tails (qtet < 0) of
both distributions are almost negligible (Figure S6). As
indicated above, such a tetrahedral-like H-bond arrangement
of the internal water is attributed to both water−water (2.17)
and water−residue H-bonds (1.33). Accordingly, the residues
mixed with internal water are also involved in the H-bond
networks of internal water rather than being the perturbation
at the boundaries of the networks. This is distinct from the
impacts of proteins or other macromolecules on the H-bond
network of their hydration water.58−60 In short, the internal
water can maintain bulk-like tetrahedral H-bond networks with
the participation of the residues.
We further analyzed the energetic and entropic properties of
the hydration environment of FUS PLD. The interaction
energy of water was directly calculated, and the entropy of
water was computed based on the two-phase thermodynamic
(2PT) method (see the Supporting Information for de-
tails).19,61 As depicted in Figure 3a, the internal water exhibits
a highly favorable water−protein energetic change (ΔUpw) of
−23.8 ± 0.9 kJ·mol−1 per water molecule, effectively
compensating for its reduced water−water energy (ΔUww)
due to the decreased H-bonds with water (using bulk water as
a reference). The total energetic change (ΔU) of internal water
is 16.3 ± 0.7 kJ·mol−1, which is higher than the total energetic
change of external hydration water (12.5 ± 0.1 kJ·mol−1).
Meanwhile, due to increased confinement within the protein
interior, the internal water experiences a moderate entropic
cost (TΔS) of −2.4 ± 0.2 kJ·mol−1 per water molecule, which
is slightly higher than that of the external hydration water (0.6
± 0.1 kJ·mol−1). Based on these results, we estimated the
Helmholtz free energy changes (ΔF = ΔU − TΔS)62
associated with the transfer of a water molecule from bulk to
the hydration environment (i.e., protein surface or the protein
interior). The free energy change of internal water is up to
−13.9 ± 0.7 kJ·mol−1, which is apparently higher than that of
external hydration water (−11.8 ± 0.2 kJ·mol−1). In other
words, the moderate entropic cost of internal hydration is well
compensated by the strong water−protein interactions. This is
essential for the existence of abundant internal water and their
well mixture with residues within FUS PLD.
It is important to note that internal water molecules still
maintain considerable mobility despite their strong water−
protein interactions. The dynamics of hydration water of FUS
PLD are characterized by residence times, which were obtained
by fitting the time autocorrelation function (Figure 3b, see the
Supporting Information for details). The average residence
time of internal water is 154.6 ps. This is modestly slower than
the average residence time of external hydration water (55.1

8319ps) but is still several orders of magnitude faster than the
internal water confined in folded proteins. Figure 3c depicts
representative snapshots of the evolution of the wet
conformations. The internal and external hydration molecules
at Δt = 0 ns are represented by red and pink balls. The bulk
water molecules flowing into the hydration environment (i.e.,
external hydration layer and protein interior) at the subsequent

internal water and external hydration water can readily
exchange with the bulk solvents. Over 40% of initial internal
water exchanges within 0.1 ns, and there is only 2% remaining
at Δt = 5.0 ns. Meanwhile, the protein undergoes continuous
conformational fluctuations (highlighted in green) accompa-
nied by the flow of water molecules. Moreover, the correlation
between the conformational fluctuations and the dynamics of
hydration water was systematically investigated from the
perspective of chain segments.63 The Pearson correlation

8320the local hydration water number were calculated for all
segments with a length of 40 amino acids. As depicted in
Figure S7a, ∼83% of the chain segments exhibit considerable
correlations (ρ beyond 0.5). These results collectively suggest
that the conformational fluctuations of FUS PLD should be
coupled to the dynamic exchange of hydration water.
To better depict the coupling of the conformational
fluctuations of FUS PLD with its hydration dynamics, we
analyzed the protein self-energy fluctuations (δEP−P) and
energy fluctuations of the protein with its hydration environ-
ment (δEP−HW). Figure 4a depicts representative trajectories of
δEP−P and δEP−HW for FUS PLD. It can be seen that these two
energy fluctuations show apparent anticorrelation. The contour
representation of the bivariate distribution of δEP−P and
δEP−HW based on all trajectories is demonstrated in Figure 4b.
The corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient is up to
−0.88. It is worth mentioning that strong negative energetic
correlations between segmental self-energy fluctuations and
local hydration energy fluctuations were also sustained for the
majority of chain segments (Figure S7b). These strong
anticorrelations illustrate the efficient energy exchange
between the protein and its hydration environment.64 In
other words, the conformational fluctuations of FUS PLD can
be effectively driven by protein−water energy fluctuations
arising from the rapid water exchange between its hydration
environment and the bulk environment. Moreover, the
correlation between the fluctuations of inter-residue energy
and water-residue energy was also systematically analyzed for
each residue (Figure 4c). Notably, 95% of the residues exhibit
considerable anticorrelation between these energy fluctuations
(ρ beyond −0.50, blue bars). Such residue-level energetic
correlations ensure the effective coupling of hydration water
functions to the overall conformational fluctuations and
promote conformational rearrangement of FUS PLD.
As shown above, there are sufficient couplings between
almost all residues and the hydration environment of protein.
It should be noted that many residues are located inside the
protein with less exposure to the external hydration layer (RSA
< 0.2). These internal residues comprise ∼32% of the total
residues in the protein (Figure 4d). With the help of abundant
internal water, the internal residues remain considerably
hydrated. On average, each internal residue is hydrated by
5.1 internal water molecules. The continuous exchange of
these internal water molecules should thus be crucial for the
dynamics of internal residues. Figure 4e demonstrates the
trajectories of the inter-residue energy fluctuations of a
representative internal residue (SER135, highlighted in yellow)
as well as the energy fluctuations of internal water with this
residue. It can be seen that the internal residue exhibits a
remarkable anticorrelated energetic coupling with internal
water, while its energy correlation with external hydration
water is negligible (gray lines). The energetic correlation
coefficients for internal residues were further calculated based
on all trajectories (Figure 4f). ∼75% of the internal residues
can maintain apparent anticorrelation with internal water, with
ρ beyond −0.50. These results suggest that sufficient energetic
couplings of residues in the protein interior with the hydration
environment originate mainly from the abundant internal

8321water throughout the protein. The continuous exchange of
abundant internal water can effectively promote conforma-
tional fluctuations inside the collapsed conformations. Taken
together, the wet collapsed conformation of FUS PLD could
be regarded as a molecular-scale open system, which maintains
overall conformational dynamics through the exchange of
water molecules.
Within such an open conformation, the exchange of internal
water molecules essentially affects the conformational dielectric
property. The effective dielectric constant (εeff) of the wet
conformation (i.e., the protein and its internal water) is
estimated using the Fröhlich−Kirkwood theory (see the
Supporting Information for details). The εeff of FUS PLD is
about 45, which is much higher than folded proteins (εeff <
10).65,66 As indicated by previous works,67−69 the H-bonds are
susceptible to the dielectric property and are considerably
weakened in such a high dielectric environment. In fact, the
residue−residue H-bonds of FUS PLD are transient, and the
average H-bond lifetime is only 62.5 ps (Figure S8). This is
close to the H-bonds formed between residues and internal
water (35.5 ps). Moreover, the residues tend to form more H-
bonds with internal water than with other residues (Figure 5a).
On average, each residue has 0.79 residue−residue H-bonds,
while forming 1.05 H-bonds with internal water. It should be
noted that internal water can further act as water bridges
(Figure 5a, inset panel) to connect residues through the water-
residue H-bonds. As shown in Figure 5b, there are 50 ± 7
internal water bridges within the wet conformation. These
abundant water bridges interfere with the direct H-bonds
between residues. Such connections of internal water between
residues should also be responsible for the intensive coupling
between the exchange of internal water and conformational
fluctuations. In short, the abundance of dynamic internal water
disturbs the formation of residue−residue H-bonds within the
wet conformation.
It is worth noting that internal water molecules tend to form
H-bonds with the backbone of FUS PLD (∼59% of water-
residue H-bonds). Such a preference of the internal water
considerably disturbs the backbone H-bonds. The backbone
H-bonds constitute only 34% of the H-bonds between the
residues. This is in sharp contrast to the dominance of
backbone H-bonds in folded proteins.70 For example, back-
bone H-bonds constitute 65% of the aforementioned cyclo-
philin protein. It is well-known that the onset of IDPs’
aggregation is associated with the emergence and accumulation
of ordered structures, especially β-structures.16,71,72 These
ordered structures involve the regular patterns of backbone H-
bonds.73 Accordingly, the disturbance of abundant internal
water to the backbone H-bonds should alleviate the formation
of aggregation-prone ordered structures within FUS PLD.
Figure 5c displays representative snapshots of the evolution of
transiently ordered structures in the wet conformation. It can
be seen that the ordered structures readily disappear with the
enrichment of internal water. Furthermore, the correlation
between the ordered structure contents and internal water
numbers was also analyzed (Figure 5d). The correlation
coefficient of −0.46 suggests that the abundance of internal
water can suppress the emergence of extended ordered
structures. As indicated in Figure 3a, there is a significant
dehydration penalty for internal water (−ΔF) which effectively
limits the dehydration process of FUS PLD. Thus, the wet
conformation with sufficient internal hydration can contribute
to the conformational disorder of FUS PLD. Taken together,
internal water effectively disturbs the formation of backbone
H-bonds and ordered structures, which may be crucial for FUS
PLD to maintain a highly disordered conformation in the
condensed phase.
Additionally, the abundance of internal water could alleviate
the energetic conflicts arising from competing interactions
among the heterogeneous arrangements of residues. The
mixture of internal water with residues can avoid the tight
packing of residues. Besides, the dynamic exchange of internal
water engenders a high dielectric environment, which blurs the
energetic difference between residues. To quantify the
energetic conflicts of the wet conformation of FUS PLD, the
local energetic frustrations were estimated based on the
configurational frustration index (Figure S9).74 Its wet
conformations maintain considerable fractions of minimally
frustrated interactions (33 ± 5%) and limited fractions of
highly frustrated interactions (9.8 ± 2%). Both are even
comparable to the native state of folded proteins wherein
energetic conflicts between residues are minimized.75 In short,
the energetic frustrations within FUS PLD are largely
eliminated throughout the conformation evolution, which
also facilitates its overall conformational dynamics.
In summary, we have demonstrated that FUS PLD adopts
the wet collapsed conformation, in which most residues are
sufficiently hydrated with the assistance of abundant internal
water. The internal water can rapidly exchange between the
protein interior and the bulk, which enables the intensive
coupling of the entire protein with its hydration environment.
Such dynamic exchange of water molecules is intimately
correlated with the overall conformational fluctuations of FUS
PLD. Moreover, the abundance of dynamic internal water
leads to a high dielectric environment within the protein,
which disturbs the H-bonds between residues and further
suppresses the formation of aggregation-prone ordered
structures. Given similar sequence compositions of PLDs,
i.e., the enrichment of polar residues, the wet conformations,
and the impacts of internal water on their conformations
should be applicable to other PLDs. Moreover, the enhance-
ment of the hydration water within PLD should help to inhibit
their aggregation propensity. Interestingly, a recent experiment
confirmed that the addition of trimethylamine-N-oxide, which
enhances protein hydration, could effectively inhibit PLD’s
aggregation within condensates.76 Our insights about the
importance of internal hydration suggest a viable therapeutic
strategy for tuning the conformation properties of IDPs to
limit protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract
The human prion protein gene (PRNP) is mapped to the short arm of
chromosome 20 (20pter‐12). Prion disease is associated with mutations in the
prion protein‐encoding gene sequence. Earlier studies found that the mutation
G127V in the PRNP increases protein stability. In contrast, the mutation
E200K, which has the highest mutation rate in the prion protein, causes
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and induces protein aggrega-
tion. We aimed to identify the structural mechanisms of E200k and G127V
mutations causing CJD. We used a variety of bioinformatic algorithms,
including SIFT, PolyPhen, I‐Mutant, PhD‐SNP, and SNP& GO, to predict the
association of the E200K mutation with prion disease. MD simulation is
performed, and graphs for root mean square deviation, root mean square
fluctuation, radius of gyration, DSSP, principal component analysis, porcu-
pine, and free energy landscape are generated to confirm and prove the
stability of the wild‐type and mutant protein structures. The protein is
analyzed for aggregation, and the results indicate more fluctuations in the
protein structure during the simulation owing to the E200K mutation;
however, the G127V mutation makes the protein structure stable against
aggregation during the simulation.

1 | INTRODUCTION
The accumulation of the pathological form of prion
protein in human and animalbrains causes priondiseases.
Evidence suggests that a pathological form of prion
protein is created by the transition of natural prion
protein (with 42% α‐helix)toabnormalprion protein (with
43% β‐sheet) that causes the alpha helix deformed β‐sheet
structure, which is reported in both humans and
animals.1–4 These fatal neurodegenerative maladies
include symptoms such as rapidly developing dementia,
difficulty walking and changes in gait, hallucinations,
muscle stiffness, difficulty speaking, fainting, and finally,
death. Human prion diseases develop in three forms
J Cell Biochem. 2023;124:254–265.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jcb254 | © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.sporadic, genetic, and infectious; genetic factors account
for about 10%−15% of all human prion disorders, such as
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann–Straussler–
Scheinker syndrome, and fatal‐familial‐insomnia.5,6
The prion protein gene (PRNP) is located on the short
arm of chromosome 20 (20pter‐12), which is known as
PRNP.7 The primary encoded protein by PRNP has 253
amino acids (two structurally separated segments,
including n‐terminal and c‐terminal), while mature prion
protein has only 209 amino acids. The prion protein's
globular domain is located at this protein's carboxyl
terminus. The globular domain has three alpha Helix,
which include amino acid sequences 144−154 (helix 1),
173−194 (helix 2), and 200−228 (helix3), respectively.
This region also contains two parallel short beta
structures containing amino acid sequences 128−131
(β‐sheet 1) and 161−164 (β‐sheet 2). The disulfide bridge
between the cysteine 179 (Cys‐179) and cysteine 214
(Cys‐214) amino acids bind Helix 2 and Helix 3 together.
Two glycosylated areas are located on asparagine 197
(Asn‐197) and asparagine 181 (Asn181).8–12 The spatial
structure of the globular domain of prion protein is
available for testing.
Mutations in the prion protein‐encoding gene region
are responsible for creating the genetic state of the prion
disease. So far, more than 50 pathogenic point mutations
of the PRNP have been identified in connection with a
variety of prion diseases.13–15 Regarding their pathoge-
nicity implications, we can classify the mutations that
occur in the prion protein into two categories: (i) Patho-
genic mutations cause prion diseases in the person
carrying the mutation, such as D178V, E200K, and so
forth.16–19 (ii) Disease‐preventive mutations in the
carrier, such as G127V, M129V, and E219K.13,20–23 A
researcher has reported E200K non‐synonymous single
nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) several times, dem-
onstrating phenotypic effects in CJD.24,25
The E200K mutation was first identified by research-
ers in 1989 and was determined as the dominant
Mendelian causative agent of the prion disease in
1991.26 Although many studies have been done on prion
diseases, the mechanism of underlying prion diseases has
been poorly understood, and there is no cure. The
substitution of glutamate amino acid with lysine amino
acid in codon 200 human prion protein (E200K) with the
highest mutation rates in this position leads to the
development of CJD in humans.14,27 Recent studies
identified that the E200K mutations are most common
in various European countries. E200K is the third most
common genetic mutation identified among Chinese
patients diagnosed with CJD. New mutations of G127V
in Papua New Guinea have been identified as utterly
resistant to prion disorder, although the resistance
mechanism is unknown.20 It is generally accepted that
changes in protein function may be induced by the
occurrence of single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in
the coding region, either directly or by conversion in
protein structure.28,29
These days, computational platforms have become
well‐known for predicting disease‐related nsSNPs
researchers.30–32 In the current research, different
computational servers were performed to comprehend
the substitution of glutamate amino acid with lysine in
codon 200 in PRNP (E200K) protein. A variety of
bioinformatics tools, including Sorting Intolerant from
Tolerant (SIFT),33 Polymorphism Phenotyping (Poly-
Phen),34 I‐Mutant,35 PhD‐SNP,36 and SNP& GO,37 are
used to predict the association of the E200K mutation
with disease. In most research due to prion maladies,
molecular dynamics simulations have been used to
investigate the cause of prion diseases at the molecular
level. This study used a molecular dynamics simulation
approach to find prion protein's structural and functional
changes due to E200K substitution. GROMACS inbuilt
tools like g_rms, g_rmsf, g_gyrate, g_covar, g_anaeig,
and g_sham were applied for protein trajectories atomic
interaction analysis. In the current study, one of the most
deleterious prion protein mutations (E200K) is screened
with various bioinformatics servers and compared with
prion completely resistance mutation (G127V) and
wild type (WT) model of prion protein by molecular
dynamics simulation.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Disease‐associated nsSNP
prediction
The SIFT algorithm was used to evaluate an amino acid
substitution affects protein function based on sequence
homology and the physical properties of amino acids.
SIFT server prediction score equal to or less than 0.05 is
considered deleterious for amino acid substitution. Poly-
Phen is a server that predicts the effect of an amino acid
substitution on the structure and function of a human
protein, damaging nsSNP computed by a position‐specific
independent counts (PSIC) score of more than 0.05.
I‐Mutant server is a technique with the Support Vector
Machines method, and the basis of this tool is protein
stability. For a score less than zero, the nsSNP is
considered harmful. I‐Mutant predicts free energy change
(DDG) based on the difference between unfolding Gibbs
free energy change of mutant and WT proteins. In
addition, we used SNPs&GO and PhD‐SNP to predict
the association of the mutation with prion disease.

In this research, we used SIFT, Polyphen‐2, I‐Mutant 3.0,
SNPs&GO, and PhD‐SNP to analyze E200K, revealing
this mutation's impact on prion illness. First, the
information on human PRNP nsSNP (E200K) as
deleterious nsSNP was collected from published
articles.14,26,38,39 Then the amino acid sequence of the
human prion protein was extracted from the UniProt
database (UniProt ID: P04156). The NMR structure of the
PRNP was obtained from Brookhaven Protein Data Bank
(PDB ID: 1HJM), the NMR structure of the human prion
protein (hPrP) globular domain with residues 121−230 at
Ph 7.0. It has three alpha‐helixes with residues 144−156,
174−194, and 200−228 and a short anti‐parallel β‐sheet
with residues 128−131 and 161−164.12 Then, the SPDB
viewer was used to search for missing atoms and perform
energy minimization. The modifications of the PDB
structure were achieved by Accelrys Discovery Studio
4.140 and Pymol.41 Finally, energetic optimization and
MD simulations were performed by GROMACS v5.42
2.3 | Molecular dynamics simulation
Molecular dynamics simulation for all structures was
done by GROMACS v542 package on running Linux
Ubuntu 16.04 operating system. We used force field
GROMOS96 43a143 for simulation. WT and mutant
proteins were solvated in a cubic box with a dimension
of 52.0A,° including single‐point‐charge water. The
structures were neutralized to create the electrically
neutral simulation system by adding Na+ and Cl− ions at
physiological pH. Energy minimization was performed
for 1000 steps by the steepest descent methods. Then
molecular dynamics simulation was carried out in three
steps containing NVT‐MD (constant number of particles
[N], volume [V], and temperature [T]), NPT‐MD
(constant number of particles [N], pressure [P], and
temperature[T]) for 1000 picoseconds (ps) at 300K and
the final simulation production were carried out at 300k
for 300ns for WT protein, E200K, and G127V models. We
then calculated the comparative analysis of structural
deviations in the WT and mutant structures.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Prediction of association between
E200K mutation and prion disease
This study uses bioinformatics algorithms such as SIFT,
PolyPhen, I‐Mutant, SNP&GO, and PhD‐SNP to under-
stand the association of mutation (E200K) with the
disease. In the first step, the result of the analysis of the
E200K mutation by SIFT server (p=0.01) was predicted
to be deleterious. PolyPhen (PSIC=1) showed its effect
on protein structure and function. Also, the output of the
I‐Mutant server (DGG=−0.28) represented the effect of
the E200K mutation on the protein structure instability
(Table 1). Further, the servers SNP&GO and PhD‐SNP
results revealed the association of E200K mutation to
prion disease (Table 2).
3.2 | Protein data set
The WT PRNP structure was obtained from the protein
data bank (PDB: 1HJM). To better understand the effects
of mutation on protein dynamics, we classified prion
structures into three categories based on secondary
structure, three a‐helix (H1, H2, and H3), two β‐sheets
(S1 and S2), and a disulfide bridge (DB) (Figure 1A). The
cocrystallized water molecules were removed. Using
Swiss PDB Viewer, Discovery Studio, and Pymol, point
mutations are induced at positions 127 and 200 of the
WT human prion protein, with Glycine (G) at location
127 replaced by Valine (V) and Glutamate (E) at position
200 replaced by Lysine (K) (Figure 1B). The interactions
of surrounding residues were checked for each WT and
mutant amino acids with the help of DynaMut server. As
a result, we found that the weak h‐bond proximal
interaction was not formed with R164 in the case
of G127V compared to the G127 prion protein
(Figure 2A,B). An additional hydrophobic proximal
interaction was found in E200K with K204 compared to
E200 prion protein (Figure 2C,B). The interactive colors
are as follows: the h‐bonds in the dark orange, weak/
water‐mediated weak h‐bonds in orange, halogen bonds
in blue, ionic interactions in yellow, aromatic contacts in

3.3 | Molecular dynamics simulation
We performed the molecular dynamics simulation of the
WT and mutant structures containing E200K and G127V
over 300ns to understand the structural dynamics and
stability effect of mutant models on prion protein. The
five factors, containing tolerance index, PSIC score, DDG
value, subPSEC score, and disease‐association study,
confirm the conformational changes in prion protein
residues due to the mutation (E200K), which can change
the functional behavior of protein molecules. The
importance of the resistant effect of G127V mutation
to prion disease and the results obtained in the above
analysis on E200K mutation further motivated us to
monitor the dynamic behavior of wild and mutant
types (E200k and G127V) variants of prion proteins.
Then we performed root mean square deviation
(RMSD), secondary structure (DSSP), root mean
square fluctuation (RMSF), the radius of gyration
(Rg), porcupine plots, and Gibbs' free energy landscape
(FEL) analysis of all the structures (WT, E200K, and
G127V) in the prion protein.
3.4 | RMSD
RMSD values were calculated for three model structures
over 300ns (WT, G127V, and E200K) (Figure 3). The
backbone RMSD value ranged from 0.15 to 0.4nm for all
trajectories. During the first 100ns, the WT model
indicates an increasing trend from 0.15 to 0.38nm.
Suddenly, the RMSD value of WT during the 100−150ns
dropped to 0.16nm, and till the end of the simulation,
the WT model showed a lower RMSD measure as
compared to G127V and E200K structures, respectively.
The G127V model shows an increasing trend from 0.15 to
0.35nm during the first 20ns. After that, till 75ns, the
measure of RMSD decreased slightly to 0.16nm, then the
amount of G127V grew slowly up to 170ns and reached
0.35nm, and till to end of the simulation, RMSD
remained stable in the case of the G127V model. E200K
model demonstrates a rising trend from 0 to 25ns, about
0.2−0.38nm; however, after that, till 75ns, RMSD
decreases to almost 0.22nm. Then RMSD increases to
4nm at 100ns dramatically. According to the RMSD plot,
the E200K model attains the maximum deviation till the
end of the simulation compared to the WT and G127V
structure. RMSD plot demonstrates significant stability
loss in three parts of simulation time, such as 40−50,
90−110, and 140−175ns for the E200K model. The
information obtained from the RMSD plot illustrates that
on an average amount of instability E200K>WT>
G127V, respectively.

all structures is E200K>WT>G127V, respectively. The
highest RMSFs scores were observed in the E200K
structure due to E200k mutation, two peaks remarked
in the β1 and end of helix 2, which localized around the
residues 132−134 and 191−196 (LYS194), respectively.
An unusual peak in the model E200K has been observed
in the β1 region with a value of approximately 0.43nm,
which is correlated with the MET134 amino acid. The
highest fluctuation is remarked in the C‐terminus of
Helix 2, with a maximum value of approximately
0.56nm, which is correlated with the LYS194 amino
acid. G127V as a protective mutation demonstrates less
RMSF than two other structures (E200K, WT) at the end
of Helix 2. The central parts of Helix 2 and Helix 3 show
the lowest RMSF score.
3.6 | Secondary structural
analysis (DSSP)
Secondary structural elements as a function of simula-
tion are shown in Figure 5. It has been observed that the
WT and G127V models follow the same pattern during
the simulation with less fluctuation. However, the G127V
model is more stable than WT during simulation time.
On the other hand, most changes in the secondary
structure of the protein were related to the C‐terminus of

simulation. Although results obtained from the second-
ary structure have depicted fluctuation at the end of helix
2 for all three models (WT, G127V, E200K), the E200K
has shown extensive conversion from helix to turn, bend,
b‐bridge, and β‐sheet that support the RMSF pattern in
Figure 4. The significant variation of the secondary
structure is related to the C‐terminus of Helix‐2 at 50, 100,
150, and 220ns, with variations observed as β‐Sheet and
B‐Bridge for E200K mutant result, in which the peak of
changes is related to 100ns in the c‐terminus of helix2 that
conversion to β‐sheet is seen. In the C‐terminus of Helix‐2,
due to E200K, during the simulation, variations in the form
of the Bend, Turn, B‐bridge, and β‐sheet are always seen,
which is related to amino acids 189−197. During the
simulation, B1 is extended. Changes at the C‐terminus
Helix 3 are visible as Turn and Bend in all three models
(WT, G127V, and E200K). The order of secondary structure
deviation is E200K>WT>G127V, respectively.
3.7 | The Rg
The prion protein compactness was explored with the
help of the Rg factor from GROMACS. Figure 6 shows
the Rg of the protein plot obtained by the g_gyrate tool of
the GROMACS package. On average, the Rg value for all
structures ranged between 1.37 and 1.52nm. The Rg of
native protein primarily decreased from 1.5 to 1.4 until
150ns, but the Rg value increased during the last 100 ns
of the simulation to approximately 1.5nm. The Rg plot
for the E200K structure represents a significant decrease
from 1.52 to 1.37nm from the 25 to 125ns of simulation;
then, the Rg value increases up to 152ns at 170nm. In
the G127V structure, the first 100ns Rg value increased
up to 1.51nm, and this value decreased for this model to
1.38nm during the last 150ns of simulation.
3.8 | Principal component
analysis (PCA)
The first few eigenvectors, or principal components
(PCs), of the structures have been shown to play a key
role in describing overall system motions. The PCA
analysis based on C‐α atoms has been performed to
analyze the collective motion of all models (WT, G127V,
& E200K). As a result, the first 50 eigenvectors of PRNP
models (WT, E200K, G127V) were analyzed and plotted
in Figure 7A. The result shows that G127V is a stable
model compared to WT and E200K models.
We have identified that the first two eigenvectors
provide the most considerable portion of the total
dynamics of the entire system. Hence, only the first
two eigenvectors have been plotted against each other,
with each line representing protein‐associated motions
(Figure 7B). As a consequence of the findings, the E200K
structure shows very stable clustered lines compared to
other models, and The G127V structure demonstrates a

show a more stable structure, whereas more scattered
lines represent the less stable structure.
3.9 | Porcupine analysis
The motion's direction and magnitude, corresponding to
the first two PCs (PC1 and PC2) constructed from 300ns
molecular dynamics simulation, are depicted by the red
conic arrows in Porcupine plots in Figure 8. Overall, the
E200K model shows more motion compared to the WT
and G127V models; furthermore, porcupine plots indi-
cate that G127V has the slightest movement. In this
analysis, most fluctuations in motion are related to the
beginning of the globular domain, the end of β‐sheet 1,
helix two c‐terminal, the part between helix two and
helix three, and the end of helix 3 in model E200K. The
order of the relative amplitude of motion of the Cα
atoms in the three models is E200K>WT>G127V,

The FEL framework is one way of describing protein
folding, which is still an open subject in science. FEL can
show a biostructure's global minima energy conformation
(protein). If biostructure has low stability, it can attain
multiple minimum energy clusters. On the other hand, a
strong and stable structure conformation can achieve
almost a single conformation energy cluster.44 GROMACS
inbuilt scripts (g_covar, g_anaeig, and g_sham) were used
to calculate the first two PCs (PC1 and PC2) as reaction
coordinates, resulting in FEL for three models. The basic
function of g_sham is to plot Gibbs FEL by Boltzmann
inverting multidimensional histograms with PC1 and PC2
as input. Figure 9 represents the EFL plot for WT, E200K,
and G127V models. In the FEL plots, Dark violet/blue
regions reflect the energy minima and energetically favored
structural conformation, and red/yellow regions indicate
the unfavorable structural conformation. The shallow and
narrow energy basin indicates the low stability of structural
conformation. According to the FEL plots in Figure 9,
the G127V showed more stability than the WT and
E200K models.

CONCLUSION
SNPs cause more genetic diversity in humans. These
polymorphisms appear in the coding region of the
protein in two forms (types), synonymous SNPs and
nsSNPs. Among these SNPs, nsSNPs cause amino acid
residue change in the protein sequence45,46 and can
cause changes in protein function due to changes in
protein structure and folding.47–49 In silico methods are
researchers' most common approach to gathering infor-
mation about the etiology of prion diseases.50–53 There-
fore, due to the importance of nsSNPs, we used various
prediction methods and algorithms to analyze the E200K
mutation, destabilizing the prion protein. E200K muta-
tion was predicted deleterious by using SIFT, Polyphen,
and I‐Mutant tools, with SIFT score=0.01, PSIC=1.000,
and DDG=−0.28 (Table 1). Moreover, this nsSNP was
predicted disease‐associated by using PhD‐SNP and
SNP&GO servers (Table 2). Molecular dynamics simula-
tion, a powerful computational method, was performed
for the prion disease‐associated nsSNP (E200K) model,
G127V model (as resistant nsSNP to prion disease), and
WT models of prion protein to examine the structural
dynamics and the stability of E200K and G127V models
as compared to WT structure.

articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseThe RMSD was computed for all Cα atoms from
starting structures to describe the convergence of the
protein system. RMSD values were plotted for E200K,
G127V, and native structure (Figure 3). As represented
by Yun et al.,54 a larger RMSD is related to less stability;
the highest fluctuation in the RMSD plot is related to the
E200K model is visible with a maximum value of
approximately 0.4nm at almost 100ns. Moreover, the
lowest value is related to the G127V structure, with a
minimum value of approximately 0.15nm at about 75
and 230ns. The RMSF of Cα atoms between the residues
for three structures (E200K, G127V, and WT) was
calculated to detect the effect of mutation on the dynamic
behavior of residues (Figure 4). It is considered that the
maximum value of RMSFs occurs at the end of β‐sheet 1,
helix 2, and Helix 3. So, it can be suggested that these
protein regions have a crucial role in conformational
rearrangements. G127V, as a protective mutation,
demonstrates less RMSF than other structures (E200K
and WT) at the end of Helix2, which can suggest that this
stability is a result of the protective role of this mutation.
However, the lowest RMSFs score is related to the
central parts of Helix 2 and Helix 3, in which there is a
single disulfide bridge between these two helixes
(Cys179–Cys214). Therefore, it may be supposed that
this connection makes the protein more stable in
mentioned areas.9,55–57
Maps of secondary structure changes obtained from
MD simulations are depicted in Figure 5. The most
changes in the secondary structure of the protein are
related to the C‐terminus of Helix 2 and B1‐strand in the
E200K model during the 300ns simulation. The E200K
model has shown extensive conversion from helix to
turn, bend, b‐bridge, and β‐sheet. As a result, we have
observed higher RMSF values in E200K model residues
(Figure 4). Therefore, the loss of stability in the E200K
mutant structure is suggested by the consequence of
protein aggregation in the E200K mutant model. The
graph of Rg for alpha‐carbon of the protein versus time at
300 k is depicted in Figure 6. During the MD simulation,
the Rg value of the G127V structure is found to drop.
In comparison to the G127V model, the E200K and
WT structures show more flexibility. This confirmed our
theory far more. According to the average Rg graph, the
G127V structure was more stable than E200K and the
native model. The outcomes of the PCA, porcupine, and

articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseFEL plots indicated that the E200K model had a
destabilizing impact compared to the WT and G127V
models. According to the porcupine plot, the end of
β‐sheet 1, helix 2, and helix 3 and the portion between helix
2 and 3 exhibits more fluctuation. Furthermore, porcupine
plotsreveal that G127V has the least movement and the EFL
plot indicates higher stability for the G127V structure in
contrast to the WT and E200K models.
The molecular dynamics simulation study on a
normal and mutated E200K protein model demonstrates
that the E200K mutation caused a change in the
secondary structure of the protein. This study's results
indicate that the end of β‐sheet 1, Helix 2, Helix 3, and
the turning region between Helix 2 and Helix 3 can be
proposed as a site for initiating protein alterations to
β‐sheet and aggregation to amyloids. According to the
study on prion protein resistance by G127V mutation
against prion diseases20,58 and the results obtained from
the MD simulation outputs, it can be interpreted that The
G127V mutation prevents structural changes and fluctu-
ations in the suggested amyloid initiation region and
makes these regions more stable against fluctuations and
structural rearrangement.12,59–62 We have analyzed one
of the most deleterious prion protein nsSNP (E200K) with
various bioinformatics servers and also compared our result
with some experimentally reported phenotypic effects of
the E200K nsSNPs. On the other hand, we have performed
a molecular dynamics simulation of the E200K structure,
G127V structure, and native protein structure. Due to
information obtained from the server's screen and molecu-
lar dynamics simulation analyses, it can be understood that
some mutation, such as E200K in the protein sequence, has
a loss of stability effect and cause aggregation in protein
folding. Some rare mutations like G127V make proteins
more stable against disease.
5 | CONCLUSION
Overall, according to the results obtained from the
prediction of servers that the E200K mutation occurs as
a deleterious mutation in the prion protein structure. The
simulation results (RMSD, RMSF, RG, PCA, Porcupine,
FEL, and DSSP) show more fluctuations in the protein
structure during the simulation by the E200K mutation
at the end of β‐sheet 1, Helix 2, Helix 3, and the turning
region between Helix 2−3, and the G127V mutation
makes protein structure stable against aggregation
during the simulation. We propose to perform more
experimental and computational research on deleterious
and resistant mutations to find the mechanism of change
in protein structure and folding by these two mutant
groups (deleterious and resistant).

ABSTRACT: Cellular prion protein PrPC consists of three α-
helices, one β-sheet, and an unstructured N-terminal domain.
Misfolding of this protein into the scrapie form (PrPSc) increases
dramatically the β-sheet content. H1 is the most stable helix on
PrPC and contains an unusual number of hydrophilic amino acids.
Its fate in PrPSc is not clear. We performed replica exchange
molecular dynamics simulations on H1 alone, H1 together with an
N-terminally flanking H1B1 loop and H1 in complex with other
hydrophilic regions of the prion protein. In the presence of the
H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 sequence, H1 is almost completely
converted to a loop structure stabilized by a network of salt
bridges. On the other hand, H1 retains its helical structure alone or
together with the other sequences considered in this study. We carried out an additional simulation by restraining the distance
between the two ends of H1, mimicking a possible geometric restriction by the rest of the protein. Even though the loop was the
major conformation, a significant amount of helical structure was also observed. This suggests that the interaction with
H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 is necessary for complete helix-to-loop conversion.
1. INTRODUCTION
The conversion of the α-helix rich monomeric cellular form of
the prion protein (PrPC) to β-sheet rich oligomers (PrPSc) is
the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
(TSEs) such as Creutzfeldt−Jakob disease, Gerstmann−
Sträussler−Scheinker disease (GSS), kuru, fatal familial
insomnia, and scrapie.1−3 PrPC contains three α-helices (H1:
146−158, H2: 174−196, and H3: 203−228 in sheep) and two
short β-strands (B1: 129−134 and B2: 163−167 in sheep).4
The sequence comprising only H2 and H3 is capable to form
misfolded aggregates.5 On the other hand, residues 23−144
flanking the N-terminal side of H1 are involved in GSS.6 Thus,
both sides of H1 can form misfolded structures independent of
each other without the assistance of H1. However, the
structure and role of H1 in misfolded aggregates remain
debated. In this study, we present a loop structure for the
misfolded H1, stabilized by interactions with a particular
hydrophilic PrP sequence, determined via molecular dynamics
simulations (below, H1 will be used to refer to both the helix
in PrPC and the misfolded structure of this region in PrPSc).
The structure of PrPSc is not known. Since the same protein
can lead to more than one disease, it is likely that several
misfolded structures exist. Nevertheless, experiments indicate
that the helical content of PrPC is completely lost7 in PrPSc,
while H2 and H3 are parts of the β-sheet core of PrPSc.5,7−9 A
number of different PrPSc structures were proposed in the
literature. In the 4-rung solenoid model, H1 is incorporated
into a β-strand.10,11 The β-hairpin model consisting of in-
register β-strands also locates H1 in a β-strand, where it
interacts with H1 of the adjacent monomers.12 In the left-
handed β-helix model, H1 forms a loop.13,14 The spiral model
conserves all three helices.15,16 In another model, H2 and H3
form an aggregate, but no structure for H1 is proposed.17 On
the other hand, H/D exchange studies revealed that the region
comprising B2, H2, and H3 and the loops connecting them
were protected, suggesting that they are part of the β-sheet
core of PrPSc.7−9 However, a bimodal mass distribution was
observed for B1 together with the preceding hydrophobic
palindromic sequence8,9 and H1,8 indicating two different
conformations of PrPSc. H1 was mostly8 or completely9
unprotected. In the unprotected structure, H1 formed neither
an α-helix nor a β-strand in PrPSc.
Although experiments on the full-length prion or the C-
terminal region do not detect any sign of helical structure on
PrPSc, the situation is different for the N-terminal region. There
is experimental evidence about the presence of a helical H1 in
the misfolded human PrP(23−159), which contains the N-
terminal region of PrP truncated at the C-terminus of H1.18
The cryo-EM structure of human PrP(90−178) reveals an in-
register β-sheet structure between residues 106 and 145.19
However, the conformation of H1 is not resolved.

See https://pubs.acs.org/sharingguidelines for options on how
to legitimately share published articles.H1 is mostly composed of hydrophilic amino acids and is
the most soluble helix in the Brookhaven Protein Database.20
Simulations on the isolated helices indicated that H1 was
stable, whereas H2 and H3 were partially unfolded.21,22 Two
intrahelix salt bridges were proposed to stabilize H1.
Disruption of intrahelix salt bridges and formation of
intermolecular salt bridges with H1 of a neighboring PrP
were suggested to be involved during PrPSc aggregation.20 A
synthetic polypeptide corresponding to murine H1 retained
the helical structure in different solutions.23 CD and NMR
spectroscopies on human H1 alone and H1 with N-terminally
or C-terminally flanking residues indicated a helical structure.24
However, another study on a peptide containing H1 and the
C-terminally flanking residues observed a soluble β-hairpin
structure.25 H1 maintained a helical structure under varying
conditions such as high salt concentrations, pH variations, and
the presence of organic co-solvents.24 Stability of H1 compared
to the other PrPC helices is also highlighted by the fact that
conversion of H2 and H3 to a β-sheet structure precedes
unfolding of H1 during PrPSc formation.9 Nevertheless, at pH
= 2, where aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues on H1 were
protonated, a decrease in helical content was observed,24
providing support to the idea that H1 was stabilized by
intrahelix salt bridges. This idea was challenged by experiments
showing that mutation of the residues involved in salt bridges
did not destabilize the helical structure but increased the
efficiency of unfolding via a different pathway.26 Another study
where charged residues of H1 were mutated pointed out that
most of the mutations involving the N-terminal residues D143,
E145, and D146 of mouse PrP did not affect PrPC to PrPSc
conversion, whereas many mutations involving the C-terminal
residues R147, R150, and E151 abolished PrPSc formation.27
Interestingly, mutants where residues in each salt bridge were
exchanged such that the salt bridge was conserved but with the
charges reversed did not convert to PrPSc.27 Thus, not the salt
bridges but the charge structure of H1 appeared to be critical
for PrPSc generation.27
The fact that the regions N-terminal and C-terminal to H1
can misfold into PrPSc forms independent of H1 and of each
other suggests that the interactions of these regions with each
other and with H1 are limited at least in some PrPSc structures
(note that there are probably more than one PrPSc structures,
each leading to a different TSE). Thus, investigating the
structure of different regions separately or in the presence of
only short fragments of other regions can be a good strategy to
divide the difficult problem of prion misfolding into smaller
and more solvable ones. In this study, the misfolded structure
of H1 was investigated through replica exchange molecular
dynamics (REMD) simulations. In principle, the structure of a
given sequence can be affected by the rest of the protein via
several means. The backbone and side chains of the sequence
can interact with the rest of the protein. The distance between
the termini of the sequence can be restricted, or a hydrophobic
environment can be imposed by the rest of the protein. In the
case of H1, the possibility of a hydrophobic environment and
interactions with the backbone of this sequence can be
eliminated based on the experimental evidence that H1 is
readily available for H/D exchange.7−9 The other factors, that
is, the effect of the distance between the termini of H1 and the
interactions of its side chains with several other sequences on
the prion protein, were investigated in this study.
2. METHODS
REMD simulations28 were performed using the Amber 16
program package29−32 with the ff10 force field.33 Solvent
effects were taken into account using the Onufriev, Bashford,
and Case generalized Born (model II) method34 together with
mbondi2 atomic radii and a 0.1 M salt concentration. 12
replicas were used with temperatures 294, 310, 327, 344, 363,
382, 402, 423, 445, 468, 495, and 520 K. The temperature was
regulated with the Langevin thermostat. The time step was
taken as 1 fs. Heavy atom-hydrogen stretching movements
were constrained via the SHAKE algorithm. Exchange attempts
were performed every 5000 steps. The systems simulated in
REMD calculations were H1 (residues 146−160), H1 + H1B1
(residues 136−160), H1 dimer, H1 in complex with
H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113, and H1 in complex with
K197GENFTETDIKIMER211. In addition, H1 was simulated
with a distance restraint between the α-carbons of N146 and
Y160 such that a quadratic energy penalty with a force
constant of 100 kcal·mol−1·Å−1 was applied when this distance
was above 9 Å. The simulation length was 200 ns for the H1
dimer and the H1−H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 complex,
100 ns for the H1− K197GENFTETDIKIMER211 complex, and
265 ns for the isolated H1 and 255 ns for H1+H1B1 systems.
Average exchange success rates (without counting that of the
highest temperature, which is always 0) were 0.42 for isolated
H1, 0.34 for H1 + H1B1, 0.24 for the H1 dimer, 0.24 for H1−
K1 9 7 GENFTETDIKIMER2 1 1 , 0.26 for H1−
H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113, and 0.41 for the restrained
H1 simulations.
In the H1+H1B1 simulation, the initial geometry for all
replicas was taken from the crystallographic structure (PDB
ID: 1TQB).4 In the other REMD simulations, two different
structures for H1 were given to different replicas in order to
facilitate convergence. The initial H1 geometry for some
replicas was the loop conformation truncated from the
structure obtained in the H1+H1B1 simulation, whereas the
initial H1 geometry for the other replicas was the crystallo-
graphic one (PDB ID: 1TQB).4 To construct the complexes,
relevant sequences were truncated from the crystallographic
structure (PDB ID: 1TQB)4 and put near H1 manually. The
N- and C-termini of all peptides were capped by CH3CO− and
−NHCH3 groups, respectively. In order to prevent H1 and the
other sequences from moving infinitely away from each other,
Y153A-Y153B, Y153-E203, and Y153-S106 distances were
restrained at 20 Å. Additional restraints were used to avoid
cis/trans isomerization of peptide bonds and reversal of the
stereochemistry of the chiral atoms.
Trajectories were clustered based on the root mean square
deviations of Cα atoms with a cluster radius of 4 Å via the
hierarchical agglomerative approach using the average distance
between members of two clusters. The appearance of clusters
with respect to time is shown in Figure S1, and their fractions
at different time intervals are given in Table S1. It can be seen
from this figure and table that the populations of most clusters
are sufficiently stable to draw conclusions after 60−70 ns. Even
though the variation appears to be high for clusters 0 and 1 of
the H1 dimer, H1-K197GENFTETDIKIMER211 and H1-
H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 systems, the structures in
these clusters fall in the same category and the sum of their
fractions remains the same throughout the trajectory. For
instance, both clusters 0 and 1 from the H1-
H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 simulation contain loop con-

7192formations. Similarly, clusters 0 and 1 from the H1 dimer and
H1-K197GENFTETDIKIMER211 simulations contain helical or
distorted helical structures. The decrease in the fraction of one
cluster is similar in magnitude to the increase in the fraction of
the other cluster. Thus, the helix and loop populations are
stable along the trajectory, and the selection of the time
interval for analysis does not affect our conclusions for the
H1+H1B1, H1 dimer, and H1−H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113
and H1−K197GENFTETDIKIMER211 simulations. Hence,
clustering analysis was done on the whole trajectory for
these simulations. On the other hand, in the isolated H1
simulation, Cluster 1, which is the loop structure, is quite
abundant until ≈60th ns, whereas it is very rare afterward.
Thus, we discarded the first 60 ns for the clustering analysis of
the isolated H1 simulation.
The root mean square deviation of Cα atoms of cluster
members with respect to the cluster representatives was
calculated for the structures displayed in Figures 1−5. The
results are shown in Figure S2. Although there are fluctuations
in each cluster, the extent of these fluctuations is low in many
clusters (Figure S2D,H,I,J,L,M). Visual inspection of the
cluster members indicates that fluctuations consist of helix
distortions, movements of loop termini, or loop to helix
transition attempts (not shown).
Hydrogen bond and salt bridge occurrences were computed
within each cluster containing loop structures shown in Figures
1−5. In the calculation of hydrogen bond occurrences,
interactions with donor−acceptor distances less than 3 Å and
donor-H-acceptor angles larger than 135° were considered as
hydrogen bonds. Salt bridge distances were measured with
respect to Cζ of arginine, Cγ of aspartate, and Cδ of glutamate
residues. Interactions with distances shorter than 5 Å were
considered as salt bridges.
Umbrella sampling simulations were performed in order to
calculate the potential of mean force for different protonation
states of H1. For each umbrella sampling calculation, one of
D147, D150, E149, or E155 was protonated. The distance
between the Cα atoms of N146 and Y160 was chosen as the
reaction coordinate and scanned from 5 to 40 Å with 0.5 Å
intervals. To restrain the distance between the Cα atoms of
N146 and Y160, a quadratic restraint with a force constant of 1
kcal/mol was applied. Each window was simulated for 50 ns at
310 K with a time step of 2 ns using the SHAKE algorithm and
the Langevin thermostat. For each protonation state, 71
windows were simulated. Thus, the total simulation length for
each protonation state was 3550 ns. The N146 and Y160
distances were written to the disk at each 50 steps. The same
solvent method as in the REMD simulations was used. Free
energy profiles were constructed using the weighted histogram
analysis method.35−37 Statistical uncertainties in the potentials
of the mean force calculated using the bootstrap technique
were on the order of 10−2 kcal/mol.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Structure of H1 + H1B1. Several experimental studies
showed that prion residues C-terminal to the H1 are part of
the β-sheet core of PrPSc.7−9 Also, it was observed that residues
N-terminal to the loop connecting H1 to B1 (H1B1 loop)
acquired two conformations,8,9 one of which contributes to the
β-sheet. Since the residues flanking H1B1 and H1 are already
known to form β-strands at least in some cases, we first focused
on the intrinsic conformational behavior of H1B1 + H1
(residues 136−160). A 255 ns long REMD simulation was
performed. The initial structure in all replicas was the
conformation seen in PrPC. We clustered the trajectory using
the Cα atoms. Most clusters (comprising 96% of the
simulation) displayed a helix for H1, differing in the extent
of distortion of the helix and the conformation of H1B1
(Figure 1A). Interestingly, a loop conformation of H1
appeared during 4% of the simulation (Figure 1B). This
structure was stabilized via E149-R154, E149-R139, D147-
R154, D147-R151, E155-R151 and E155-R159 salt bridges. A
plot of the salt bridge distances within the cluster (Figure 1C)
and the occurrences of salt bridges (Table S2) indicated that
very little distortion of the salt bridge network occurred among
the members of the cluster containing loop structures. The C-
terminal half of H1B1 formed an α-helix. The interactions
between H1 and H1B1 were limited to the E149-R139 salt
bridge, two hydrogen bonds with low occurrences (Table S2),
and hydrophobic contacts such as the one between hydro-
phobic parts of H143 and R159. The E149-R139 salt bridge
was permanent (Figure 1C and Table S2), but a visual
inspection of the cluster members showed that although there
was at least one hydrophobic interaction between H1 and
H1B1, the residues involved varied among different members
of the cluster (not shown).
3.2. Structure of Isolated H1. We next investigated
whether H1 alone was capable of folding into a loop. Both the
loop and helix conformations were given to REMD as initial
structures of different replicas. A clustering analysis showed the
presence of a loop conformation during 9% of the simulation.
However, the loop was mainly observed during the first 60 ns
and rarely appeared in the rest of the simulation (Figure S1).

7193Thus, the first 60 ns were excluded as the equilibration period,
and a new clustering analysis was performed. 99.2% of the
trajectory consisted of helical structures with different extents
of distortion (not shown). The total abundance of two clusters
containing a loop conformation was 0.8% (0.4% each). The
two loop structures differed from each other in the salt bridge
pattern (Figure 2). The E155-R151 salt bridge, which
stabilized the central part of the loop, was observed in almost
all members of both clusters (Figure 2D−E, Table S3). In the
cluster represented by the structure in Figure 2A, the D147-
R154 and E149-R154 interactions were present in most cluster
members, whereas the E149-R151, E149-R159, and D150-
R159 interactions were interchangeable with D147-R151 and
E155-R159 salt bridges (Figure 2D, Table S3). On the other
hand, in the cluster represented by the structure in Figure 2B,
D147-R154, E149-R154, and E149-R151 salt bridges were
interchangeable with D147-R151 and E155-R159 salt bridges
(Figure 2E, Table S3). The E149-R159 and D150-R159
interactions were almost absent (Table S3). In addition to salt
bridges, hydrogen bonds formed in some cluster members.
However, these interactions were rare, and the residues
involved varied within the clusters (Table S3). Thus, they
are not discussed here.
The variation of salt bridge patterns within each cluster and
between clusters is an indication of the flexibility of the loop
termini. An alignment of the representatives of the clusters
containing a loop in isolated H1 and H1 + H1B1 simulations
shows that the central part of the loop is very similar in all
cases, whereas the residues at both termini have different
orientations (Figure 2C).
We computed MM/GBSA free energy using the trajectory of
each cluster with the same GB method as the REMD
simulations. Surprisingly, the MM/GBSA potential energy of
the loop was 10 kcal/mol lower than that of the most
populated cluster with a helical structure (−985.1 and −975.1
kcal/mol, respectively), although the helix was much more
abundant in the REMD simulations. The electrostatic part of
the solvation free energy cannot be at the origin of this
discrepancy, as the same GB method is used in all calculations.
The non-electrostatic part of the solvation free energy is not
taken into account during REMD simulations. But it favors the
loop only by 1.3 kcal/mol (14.7 and 13.4 kcal/mol for the helix

of aspartate, and Cδ of glutamate residues (values ≈ 4−5 Å correspond to salt bridges).

7194and loop, respectively). One may expect that the helix is
stabilized by entropy. Indeed, adding the entropy contributions
using normal mode approximation reduces the free energy
difference to 6 kcal/mol. The remaining error can be attributed
to normal mode approximation. For instance, this method is
known to underestimate the entropy of internal rotations. Such
movements are expected to be less pronounced in the loop,
which displays a network of salt bridges. Thus, the entropy
contribution should be more underestimated for the helix. We
also computed quasiharmonic entropies, but the results were
unreliable as they depended largely on the number of frames
used for the calculation.
3.3. Structure of H1 in Complex with Various
Hydrophilic Prion Regions. We investigated whether the
abundance of the loop structure depended on its interactions
with other regions of PrP. Because of the unusually high
hydrophilic nature of H1, we focused on its possible
interactions with the hydrophilic regions, that is, the sequences
K197GENFTETDIKIMER211, H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113,
and another H1. The sequence K25KRPK29 was not considered
as it was not part of the misfolded PrPSc core.
In the simulation with two H1, a complex of two undistorted
helices had an abundance of 78.4% (Figure 3A). Helices were
arranged in a parallel manner, and D147A-R151B, D150A-
R151B, R151A-D147B, R154A-E155B, R159A-D147B, and
R159A-D150B salt bridges were formed (A and B denote
different H1s). Some intrahelix salt bridges were also
maintained (D147A-R151A, D150A-R154A, R151A-E155A,
E155A-R159A, D147B-R151B, and D150B-R154B). Several
clusters with partially unfolded helices displayed a total
abundance of 18% (not shown). Completely unfolded
structures, different than the loop described above, were
observed only in 3.6% of the simulation (Figure 3B). In all
complexes, a network of intermolecular and intramolecular salt
bridges was observed.
When H1 was allowed to form a complex with the sequence
K197GENFTETDIKIMER211, the total abundance of the
clusters containing helical H1 structures was 95%. The most
abundant cluster (86%) shown in Figure 4A displayed several
salt bridges between H1 and K197GENFTETDIKIMER211
(R154-E199, R151-D205, R159-E210, D147-R211). In
addition, intrahelix D147-R151, D150-R154, and D150-R159
salt bridges were observed. The K197GENFTETDIKIMER211
moiety was also stabilized by internal salt bridges (E210-R211,
D205-R211). The other clusters with a helical H1 also
exhibited a high number of salt bridges within H1 and between

7195H1 and K197GENFTETDIKIMER211, although the amino
acids involved were different (not shown).
The remaining 5% consisted of several unfolded structures.
Most of them were extended structures different from the loop
presented above (Figure 4B). Only one cluster (0.3%)
displayed a structure similar to this loop (Figure 4C). Residues
D150-Y160 of H1 were aligned with the most stable loop
conformation with an rmsd of 1.89 Å. This structure was
unique in that only one salt bridge (R159-E203) was found
between the H1 and K197GENFTETDIKIMER211 moieties,
and its occurrence is only 43.5% (Table S4). Instead of salt
bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts held the
two sequences together. However, a visual inspection of the
cluster members and Table S4 indicated that the amino acids
involved in these interactions varied within the cluster. D147-
R154, R154-E155, E155-R159, and D150-R151 salt bridges
stabilized the loop conformation interchangeably with E149-
R154, E149-R159, and D147-R151 salt bridges (Figure 4D,
Table S4).
The situation was completely different when H1 interacted
with the H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 sequence. The total
abundance of the loop structures, distributed in two clusters,
was 96%. In the most abundant structure (92%), the H1
moiety overlaps with the most stable loop conformation
described above with an rmsd of 0.79 Å. No salt bridge was
found between the two moieties. Several hydrogen bonds and
hydrophobic contacts stabilized the complex; however, a visual
inspection and occurrences in Table S5 showed that the amino
acids involved in these interactions varied within the cluster.
D147-R154, E149-R154, E149-R151, D147-R159, E149-R159,
and E155-R151 salt bridges maintained the loop structure
(Figure 5C, Table S5). The second most populated cluster
(4%) contained a loop structure somewhat distorted at both
ends. Nevertheless, the central part of H1 was similar in both
complexes (sequence D150-E155 of the two complexes aligned
with an rmsd 2 Å). E149-R154, E149-R151, E149-R159, and
E155-R151 salt bridges, and to a lesser extent, D147-R154 and
D147-R159 salt bridges, stabilized the loop structure (Figure
5D, Table S6). A variable set of hydrogen bonds and
hydrophobic interactions between the two moieties was
observed (Table S6). Unlike the most abundant complex,
the K104-D147 salt bridge was formed. The remaining clusters
contain helical H1 with limited or no interactions with
H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 (not shown).
The MM/GBSA free energy difference between the loop
and helical structures using the trajectories of the most
populated clusters containing a loop and a helix is 16.5 kcal/
mol (Gloop = −1626.3 kcal/mol, Ghelix = −1609.8 kcal/mol).
Probably, this value is highly overestimated due to the inherent
problems in normal mode entropy calculations. The entropy

7196contribution is 8.7 kcal/mol in favor of the helix, in agreement
with the results obtained for H1 alone. At least qualitatively,
our results show that, both alone and in the complex, the loop
is favored by the potential energy, whereas the helix is favored
by the entropy. For H1 alone, the entropic contribution
dominates, whereas the interactions in the complex lower the
potential energy of the loop conformation to overcome the
entropy effects.
Here, the interaction partners of H1 were taken as
completely flexible. Of course, in PrPSc, they acquire specific
conformations. Nevertheless, one may assume that if H1s
interact only with each other in an oligomer, they all fold in the
same way, rather independent of the rest of the oligomer, like
in our simulation. According to H/D exchange experiments,
H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 is in a highly accessible region
of PrPSc.7−9 Not being on a helix or β-strand, it is reasonable to
hypothesize that this sequence would largely fold together with
H1 if they interact with each other, as in our simulation. On
the other hand, the sequence K197GENFTETDIKIMER211 is
on a highly protected region of PrPSc, most likely on a β-
strand.7−9 None of the structures seen in our simulation
display a β-strand. Thus, this particular simulation is
informative only about the effect of salt bridges on the
conformational preference of H1.
3.4. Effect of the Distance Between the N- and C-
Termini of H1. The geometric restriction imposed on H1 by
covalent bonds to the rest of the protein can be mimicked by
putting a distance restraint between the residues at the termini
of H1. In the simulations described above, the distance
between the α-carbons of N146 and Y160 is ≈20 Å in the helix
and ≈10 Å in the loop. When this distance is restrained to be
≤9 Å, the abundance of the loop rises to 76%. The remaining
24% is made of distorted helical conformations (structures not
shown).
3.5. Comparison with Mutation Experiments. Nor-
strom and Mastrianni27 mutated charged amino acids on H1 to
similarly charged, oppositely charged, or uncharged amino
acids in mouse prion (for the sake of comparison, ovine PrP
numbering will be used below). In these experiments, D147E,
D147K, D147A, E149D, E149A, D150E, D150K, and D150R
mutants retained their ability to convert into PrPSc. D150A
displayed a different pattern of proteinase K-resistance than the
wild type. Among the mutations at the N-terminus of H1, only
D147R, E149K, and E149R exhibited impaired ability of
conversion. On the other hand, all mutations at the C-terminal
part of H1 concerning R151, R154, and E155 led to impaired
or completely blocked conversion, with the exception of
R151K.
In our simulations, the R151-E155 salt bridge, a crucial
interaction stabilizing the central part of the loop, was present
in almost all loop structures (Figures 1C, 2D,E, 5C,D, Tables
S2, S3, S5 and S6). The two acidic residues, D147 and E149, at
the N-terminus of the loop can substitute each other in salt
bridges. For instance, it can be seen from Figure 5D that the
D147-R154 and D147-R159 interactions are interchangeable
with the E149-R154 and E149-R159 interactions. Similarly,
according to Figures 2D,E, the D147-R151 and E149-R151 salt
bridges can replace each other. Figure 2D also shows that the
E149-R159 and D150-R159 interactions are interchangeable
with the E155-R159 interaction. In addition, the occurrence of
the E149-R154 salt bridge is less than that of the others in
Figure 5C (Table S5). All together, these observations suggest
that the N-terminal region of the loop is relatively more flexible
and negatively charged residues at this region can substitute
each other in salt bridges. On the other hand, R151, R154, and
E155 are more persistent in salt bridges and are not substituted
by other residues. These observations are consistent with
mutation experiments.
In the same study, positively and negatively charged residues
in each salt bridge in the helical structure were exchanged.
Although the salt bridges in the helical structure were
conserved in these double mutants, they did not convert to
PrPSc.27 The authors concluded that not the salt bridges but
the charge structure of H1 was critical for PrPSc generation.27
Our results show that the failure of the double mutants to
convert to PrPSc arises from the fact that the salt bridges in the
helix and loop structures are different. Therefore, while the
double mutants maintain the salt bridges in the helix form,

7197they cannot form the necessary salt bridges in the loop. For
instance, double mutants have either D147R-R151D or
D150R-R154D mutations or both. These mutants are not
capable of forming crucial interactions in the loop such as the
R151-E155 salt bridge.
3.6. Protonation of Aspartic and Glutamic Acids.
Some studies in the literature considered the protonation of
aspartic and glutamic acid residues on H1 as a sign that
conversion to PrPSc was favored in the acidic medium of
endosomes. Such a protonation is clearly incompatible with
our results since it would break salt bridges. Nevertheless, it
can be assumed that a temporary protonation of H1 may lower
the free energy barrier for the unfolding of the helical structure.
To investigate this hypothesis, we performed umbrella
sampling simulations to calculate the potential of mean force
on the structures protonated at D147, E149, D150, or E155, as
well as the unprotonated H1. The distance between the two
ends of H1, represented by the Cα atoms of N146 and Y160,
was scanned. The results are given in Figure 6. Clearly, all
protonated structures lie in shallow and broad free energy wells
and can be stretched more easily than the unprotonated one.
4. DISCUSSION
All simulations performed in this study and their outcomes are
listed in Table 1.
REMD simulations have been performed on the prion
sequence 146−160, corresponding to helix 1 in the PrPC form.
This sequence (referred to as H1) adopts two conformations: a
helical conformation (99.2%) as observed in PrPC and a loop
conformation (0.8%). The helical structure is stabilized by
intrahelix salt bridges in addition to the usual backbone
hydrogen bonds, as observed in PrPC crystals. The loop is
stabilized mainly by a network of salt bridges.
Although the loop is a negligible conformation in isolated
H1, its abundance rises to 96% in the complex with the
H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 sequence. Conversely, the in-
teraction of H1 with other highly hydrophilic sequences, that
is, K197GENFTETDIKIMER211 or another H1 (representing
H1 of an adjacent monomer) completely suppresses loop
formation. While H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 contains only
positively charged or neutral amino acids, the other two
sequences have both negatively and positively charged
residues. Thus, when the charged residues on these two
sequences interact with the pairs of residues forming a salt
bridge on H1, they can interact with both negative and positive
charges. However, the interaction of the positively charged
H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 with the negative charges on
H1 is likely to be blocked by the positive charges on H1 salt
bridges. As a result, the latter sequence binds to H1 mainly via
hydrogen bonds, whereas the other two sequences form a
network of salt bridges with H1. This difference in binding
pattern seems to determine the helix/loop preference. In the
helical form, charged amino acids are situated at the surface of
H1. They can be reoriented to form salt bridges with another
sequence without disturbing the intrahelix ones. However, the
network of internal salt bridges responsible for the stability of
the loop structure is broken upon salt bridge formation with
another sequence, abolishing this conformation. This idea is
further supported by the fact that the only H1-
K197GENFTETDIKIMER211 complex with a loop conforma-
tion of H1 has just one salt bridge between the two moieties.
Other hydrophilic sequences not considered in the present
study are also close to oppositely charged amino acids. Hence,
residues R167, D170, and R171 near the N-terminus of H2;
residues K188, K197, and E199 near the C-terminus of H2;
and residues R223 and E224 would lead to an interaction
pattern with H1 that would favor a helical conformation.
Since the loop is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and
hydrophobic interactions, one may think that the backbone
of a mostly hydrophobic prion sequence can also provide these
hydrogen bonds along with the side chains involved in
hydrophobic contacts. However, the highly hydrophilic
composition of H1 seems to prevent such interactions. For
instance, the interactions between H1 and mostly hydrophobic
H1B1 do not stabilize the loop significantly.
A significant amount of helical conformation exists even
when the end-to-end distance of H1 is restrained to a small
value. This indicates that anchoring the termini of H1 at a
short distance to each other by covalent bonds to the rest of
the protein is not enough to completely prevent helix
formation in PrPSc.
Interestingly, the average potential energy of the loop
conformation is lower than that of the helix, although the helix
is by far more abundant, suggesting that the helix is stabilized
by the entropic contribution. In the helix, the salt bridges can
be broken temporarily, making the side chains involved more
mobile. On the other hand, the loop geometry strictly relies on
the network of salt bridges. Thus, the positions and
fluctuations of the charged side chains in the helix are
significantly less restricted compared to the ones in the loop,
probably leading to a higher entropy.
H1 is experimentally known to form a helix in the misfolded
human PrP(23−159), which contains only the N-terminal
region of prion together with H1.18 According to cryo-EM
results, the region between residues 106 and 145 consists of an
in-register β-sheet structure.19 Although the conformation of
H1 is not resolved in this experiment, the in-register β-sheet
arrangement should obviously locate H1 sequences of adjacent
protomers next to each other, leading to helical structures
consistent with our simulations.
On the other hand, H1 appears to be mostly8 or completely9
unprotected in H/D exchange experiments in full-length PrPSc

7198oligomers. Our results indicate that when two H1s are allowed
to interact with each other, helical structures form. Taking
together, at least in the protomers where H1 is unprotected,
this region must be located away from the H1 sequence of an
adjacent protomer. Moreover, H1 must interact with the
H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113 sequence from the same or a
different protomer.
Since in different truncated prion proteins both the sequence
N-terminal to H118,19 and a sequence containing only H2 and
H35 are capable of forming β-rich misfolded structures, we
hypothesize that both sequences can fold into β-sheets
independently and H1 acts as a linker between them. A
possible arrangement consistent with our results and experi-
ments is given in Figure 7. The number of protomers and the
arrangement of the β-sheet core are for illustration purposes
only. Cryo-EM experiments suggest that prion fibrils consist of
two protofilaments.38 In such a case, N-terminal regions of the
protomers at the interface between two protofilaments may
interact with each other and form a β-sheet. The N-terminal
regions of the other protomers may form loops (or partially
disordered structures) such that H99SQWNKPSKPKTNMK113
is positioned next to H1. This would explain why the N-
terminal region and H1 are mostly unprotected in H/D
exchange experiments, while a fraction of protected protomers
exist. Alternatively, the N-terminal region and H1 of one
protomer may be wound on the β-sheet core of several other
protomers.
Protonation of glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues on
H1 makes the helical conformation more flexible, thus more
prone to unfold. But, in the loop form, these amino acids are
not likely to be protonated.

ABSTRACT: The aggregation and structural conversion of normal
prion peptide (PrPC) into the pathogenic scrapie form (PrPSc),
which can act as a seed to enhance prion amyloid ﬁber formation, is
believed to be a crucial event in prionopathies. Previous research
suggests that the prion monomer may play an important role in
oligomer generation during disease pathogenesis. In the present
study, extensive replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD)
simulations were conducted to explore the conformational
characteristics of the huPrP (125−160) monomer under the
histidine tautomerism eﬀect. Investigating the structural character-
istics and ﬁbrilization process is challenging because two histidine
tautomers [Nε2-H (ε) and Nδ1-H (δ)] can occur in the open
neutral state. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation outcomes have
shown that the toxic εδ and δδ isomer (containing several and broader local minima) had the highest α-helix structures, with
contents of 21.11% and 21.01%, respectively, and may have a strong inﬂuence on the organizational behavior of a monomeric prion.
The amino acids aspartate 20 (D20)−asparagine 29 (N29) and isoleucine 15 (I15)−histidine 16 (H16), D20−arginine 27 (R27) as
well as N29 formed α-helix with the highest probabilities in the δδ and εδ isomer, accordingly. On the basis of our ﬁndings, we
propose the histidine tautomerization hypothesis as a new prion accumulation mechanism, which may exist to induce the formation
of prion accumulates. Overall, our tautomerism hypothesis constitutes a promising perspective for enhancing understanding of prion
disease pathobiology and may help in the design of a good inhibitor.

■INTRODUCTION
Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs), are one of the most diverse groups
of lethal neurological diseases in animals and humans. More
importantly, they include the only known infectious amyloid
disorder, which can be transmitted from animals to humans or
from humans to humans.1−3 Pathologically, TSEs are indicated
by brain damage, motor and cognitive impairments, and
neuronal dysfunction. Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, is the best known example of a TSE in
animals; human variants of these diseases involve the
Gerstmann−Sträussler−Sheinker (GSS) disease, Creutzfeldt−
Jakob disease (CJD), and fatal familial insomnia.2,4 It is evident
that in humans, about 85% of prion disease cases are sporadic
CJD without mutation.5 The protein-only hypothesis explains
that prion infection is connected to the conformational
transition between the α-helical physiological cellular forms
of prion (PrP), PrPC, and an insoluble β-dominated pathogenic
form, PrPSC.6,7 PrP, which is expressed pervasively in
mammalian neuronal cells, is a highly conserved glycosylated
protein.8−10 The human PrP gene Prnp encodes a 253-residual
precursor peptide (Figure 1). While transferring toward the
cellular surface, the initial 23 N-terminal signal residues are
post-translationally disconnected.11 In addition, the last 23 C-
terminal amino acids are also excised after the insertion of a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor.12 Hence, PrPC is a
GPI-anchored protein located on the cell surface and consists
of an unstructured N-terminal domain (NTD) and a globular
C-terminal domain (CTD) (Figure 1). Furthermore, the NTD
region is characterized by octa-peptide repeats (amino acid
60−90) that appear to gain partial conformation upon
interaction with Cu2+ or other metals.13,14 The functions of
PrPC include copper transportation, cell adhesion, immunor-
egulation, and signal transduction.15 Moreover, PrP can arise in
various states, such as monomeric, oligomeric, or ﬁbril, all with

of the α-helical regions in PrPC must be converted to β-sheet
during PrPC → PrPSc. So, the stability of the helical part and its
tendency to transform into sheets are crucial to determining
PrP conversion.16 A vast amount of scientiﬁc activity is
currently aimed at clarifying the precise molecular mechanism
(also the inducing factors) of the conversion between the
normal and infectious forms of PrP; however, this mechanism
still remains unknown.17 The conversion of PrPC into PrPSc
and its accumulation are largely dependent on several factors,
including amino acid composition, pH, temperature, salt
concentration, and the presence of lipids and metal
ions.18−20 Another aspect that may have an important eﬀect
is histidine (His) tautomerization, which has been shown to
play a key role in peptide aggregation. Diverse forms of His
residues (namely, neutral and protonated) are correlated with
organizational properties of diﬀerent misfolded systems and
can inﬂuence the accumulation pathways in peptides, leading
to proteopathies.21−30 However, the intrinsic origin of PrP self-
assembly due to diverse His behaviors remains largely
undetermined. As misfolding of monomeric PrP and
consequent oligomerization/ﬁbrilization are closely connected
to prion disease pathology, it is essential to examine the
misfolding mechanism of the PrP monomer in the presence of
His tautomerism.31 At physiologic pH values and in the
presence of chemical denaturants, PrP accumulates through a
nucleation-dependent polymerization (NDP) mechanism that
produces long straight amyloid ﬁbrillar structures.32 Thus,
several reports have focused on PrP aggregation at
physiological pH and temperature.33−35 Hence, the objective
of this current study is to uncover the toxic mode of action of
the PrP monomer with respect to His tautomerism under
neutral physiological conditions.
Two neutral His tautomeric states [Nε2-H (ε) and Nδ1-H
(δ); Figure 2] can exist near pH 7, indicating the crucial
biological phenomena occurring in a system.36 In contrast, at
low pH, both imidazole nitrogens protonate to form cationic
imidazolium.37,38 The population ratio of the two neutral
forms (ε:δ) is around 1:0.16 at physiological pH.39,40 This
ratio may be regulated by multiple factors, including His
position (sequence number) and side chain (SC)−SC
association.41 Characterizing the tautomeric states is crucial
for understanding how the His amino acid plays structurally
and functionally important roles in peptides. Numerous
research groups already proved the importance of the histidine
tautomeric eﬀects in some enzyme catalytic reactions, proton
conductions, and protein bioactivity.42,43 NMR spectroscopy is
an eﬀective approach for identifying diverse His tautomeric
states. However, in biomacromolecules, the situation is
complicated: both the 13C and 15N chemical shifts of the His
are very sensitive to its tautomeric conditions, the chemical
environment of the imidazole rings, hydrogen bond lengths,
and the protein backbone structure. Additionally, the
protonation and deprotonation of the His imidazole ring
occurs on the picosecond time scale, faster than the NMR
frequency.44 Hence, detailed experimental analysis of the
tautomeric behavior of the His in PrP is limited. Due to these
experimental uncertainties regarding the folding and unfolding
processes and the structure of the intermediate conformations
under His tautomerisms, in silico atomistic simulation can play
a pivotal role in clarifying the potential routes to the
production of the disease state. Uranga et al. reported MD
simulation as a powerful tool to assess His protonation states
in peptides.45 Therefore, in the current research, the eﬀect of
tautomerization of His on the structure of PrP monomer was
explored by replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD)
simulations. On a similar time scale, REMD can sample more
conformational space of amyloidogenic monomers than
classical simulation can.46,47
Although PrP has several His residues, a segment including
His 140 (H140) and H155 was utilized for REMD in the
current work, because these residues are important for PrP
oligomerization and conformational transition.48−50 Further-
more, H140 is already included in the highly accumulation-
prone hot spot area of PrP (region 127−147).51 In addition,

3204previous research indicates that protonation of these two His
amino acids aﬀect PrP accumulation and ﬁbril formation.52,53
However, regarding the unprotonated conditions, there is still
a lack of research on the impact of the tautomeric condition in
neutral His residues in huPrP. As each His includes two
tautomeric states (δ and ε), four isomeric forms exist in the
present peptide chain (Table 1). The isomer is denoted as δδ
when both His are in the δ state. Likewise, the other isomers
are designated εε, εδ, and δε in accordance with their
tautomeric conditions. Although, in general, the content of δ
tautomer is lower than ε tautomeric form at neutral condition,
because of the complexity of neurodegenerative diseases, any
parameter that may aﬀect the protein misfolding should be
considered and investigated deeply. However, in some cases,
the percentage of δ tautomer is more compared to ε
tautomeric form depending on experimental conditions.52
Hence, in this complicated neuro disease, we used all possible
tautomeric forms of both His to gain insight into the structural
and misfolding features of the PrP peptide under the
tautomerism eﬀect. Herein, for the ﬁrst time, we report
evidence of PrP accumulation considering His tautomerization
and contributions to pathology in amyloidoses.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Convergence to equilibrium state is an essential criteria for
atomistic simulation output to be accurate and reproducible.54
Prior to analyzing the atomic structures of monomeric PrP, the
convergence of MD trajectories was examined via four metrics
and two-time windows of 400−500 ns/500−600 ns for δδ and
δε isomers and 600−700 ns/700−800 ns for εε and εδ,
respectively. The four considered parameters include the
probability density functions (PDFs) of the radius of gyration
(Rg), solvent-accessible surface areas (SASAs), the end-to-end
(E2E) distances, and the number of hydrogen bonds (H-
bonds). As can be seen in Figure S1, the distributions of Rg,
SASA, E2E distance, and H-bonds overlapped very well within
the time windows mentioned above in all isomers. These
outcomes suggest that REMD simulations reasonably con-
verged to an equilibrium state in 600 ns for the δδ and δε
isomers and in 800 ns for the εε and εδ isomers. On the basis
of the equilibration assessment, the last 100 ns of the
simulations data were used for subsequent analysis. VMD
software was utilized for visualization of atomic outcomes and
generation of ﬁgures.55
Reorganizations in the PrP secondary structure may happen
with the conversion of PrPC → PrPSc, which essentially
enhances its capability for amyloid ﬁbril formation.56 The
secondary structure content was measured using the Dic-
tionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) algorithm.
This protocol relies on the backbone−backbone H-bonds to
diﬀerentiate several types of secondary structural elements.57
The probabilities of the α-helical and β-sheet content were
found to be diﬀerent (Figure 3a) for PrP isomeric forms,
highlighting that the diverse neutral His tautomeric states (ε or
δ) at locations 140 and 155 can inﬂuence the structural and
misfolding properties of the monomeric PrP. In PrP protein,

3205misfolding and aggregation of α-helix are linked to a group of
brain degenerative disorders.58 Previous PrP denaturation
research has shown that PrP refolds into an α-helical
monomeric peptide followed by dimerization and undergoes
the conformational transition to sheeted oligomeric forms.59
However, as important secondary structural elements, the α-
helix content of εδ (21.11%) and δδ (21.01%) are higher than
those of the other isomeric forms. In contrast, εε and δε
tautomeric isomers displayed helix contents of 13.17 and
18.12%, respectively. The residues aspartate 20 (D20)−
asparagine 29 (N29) have the highest propensity for α-helix
formation (34−69%) in δδ and δε isomers (value: 30−56%)
(Figure 3d). Additionally, in the εε and εδ isomers, α-helices
can be found mostly at tyrosine 21 (Y21)−Y26 (content: 37−
49%) and isoleucine 15 (I15)−H16 (content: 27.6−27.7%),
D20− arginine 27 (R27) (content: 39−72%) as well as N29
(value: 31%), which ﬁts well with the experimental
reports.60−63 These helices, a signiﬁcant factor in PrP helical
dimer formation, may play a pivotal role in protein aggregation
and conversion to sheets in larger aggregates under
physiological conditions.64−69 Furthermore, the overall and
residue-speciﬁc β-sheet content of each isomer was also
calculated (Figure 3a−c), because the formation of β-sheets
has also been connected to amyloidosis.70 In this case, the
fraction of β-strand in the δδ, εε, δε, and εδ isomers are
0.0369, 0.0411, 0.0432, and 0.0301, respectively. Importantly,
low residual distributions of the parallel and antiparallel β-
sheet were found compared to the α-helical distributions in the
PrP isomeric forms, which underlines the importance of α-
helix formation in PrP monomer accumulation.71,72 Our results
are consistent with multiple studies that determined that PrP
monomer contains very little β-sheet content.67,73 On the
whole, εδ and δδ isomer may promote the transformation
pathway and prion infectivity with increased helices compared
with the other isomeric forms.
Next, to intuitively monitor the conformational properties of
each PrP isomer during the period of the REMD simulation, an
average-linkage clustering interpretation with 5 Å backbone
RMSD cutoﬀ was further carried out to extricate representative
structures from the last 100 ns trajectories. The analysis was
performed using the hierarchical agglomerative algorithm.74
Previous research highlights that the more popular algorithm
for clustering MD conformations is agglomerative hierarchical
technique since its linkage method is able to utilize the
attributes for explaining the chemical structures.75 The central
conformations of the ﬁve most-populated clusters for each
isomer and their populations are exhibited in Figure 4. The top
ﬁve most-populated conformers attribute for 12.2, 15.9, 10.5,
and 40.2% of all the conformations of the εδ, δδ, δε, and εε
tautomeric forms, respectively. Based on clustering assign-
ments, PrP εδ, δδ, and δε displayed nondominating diversiﬁed
conformations than εε. The populations of the predominant
clusters in the εδ, δδ, and δε isomers were 3.3, 3.8, and 4.1%,
respectively. In contrast, εε preferred a distinct conformation
with a probability of 30.4%. Furthermore, we found α-helices
in all clusters of the εδ and δδ isomeric forms, which supports
our previous outcomes indicating that isomers εδ and δδ have
the higher helical propensities compared to other isomers.
Such helical tautomeric isomers can be greatly neurotoxic,
because toxicity is presumed to originate from increased α-
helical production in monomeric PrP.71,72 Overall, because of
high α-helical production and neurotoxicity, δδ and εδ may
promote the PrPC−PrPSc conformational transition more than
the other isomeric states.
Thus far, signiﬁcant α-helices in all PrP isomers, which may
be a key factor inﬂuencing further accumulation, have been
discussed. To further our investigation, we created a contact
map, or 2D grid, of distances among protein residues, an
eﬃcient tool for investigating the organization of proteins in
diverse conformations. However, we examined these inter-
residue contacts on the basis of the peptide main-chain (MC).
The MC contour mapping of a macromolecule has been
frequently utilized as a depiction of peptide secondary
structure, an essential element in self-assembly and folding
phenomena.30,76 Figure 5 exhibits a contact plot for the
probability of inter-residual interactions at 308.09 K acquired
from the last 100 ns of REMD trajectory analysis with less than
1.5 nm minimum distance between atoms. From the MC−MC
contour map, thick bands along the main diagonal adjacent to
residues D20−N29 were noticed in the δε and δδ isomers,
which indicates a signiﬁcant presence of α-helices near that
region. Similarly, in the εε and εδ isomeric forms, thick streaks
close to Y21−Y26 for εε and I15−H16, D20−R27, and N29
for εδ adjacent to the central diagonal represent α-helices,
which is in accordance with the previous structural analysis. In
addition, the δδ, εε, δε, and εδ PrP isomers did not show any
intense β-strand interactions in their contact map. These
ﬁndings are in good agreement with the secondary structure
assignment indicating that monomeric PrP isomers have lower
probabilities of adopting β-sheet structures than of adopting
helix structures. Taken together, the toxic εδ and δδ isomers
have the highest α-helical probabilities, reﬂecting the important
role of residues I15−H16, D20−R27, and N29 in εδ and of
areas D20-N29 in δδ in the formation of PrP aggregates.60−69

3206In addition, we evaluated the ﬂexibility of each residue in all
isomeric forms through root-mean-square ﬂuctuation (RMSF)
analysis, which determines the variations in the C-α atom
coordinates from a neutral state.77 The peptide ﬂexibility, an
essential property for maintaining the activity of biomacromo-
lecules, is important for inhibitor design and development.
According to earlier research, receptor mobility and the
protonation states of the ionizable amino acids are
interconnected.78,79 As shown in Figure 6, the ﬂexibility
proﬁles of PrP isomers were found to be diﬀerent in the
presence of the histidine tautomeric eﬀect. The δδ isomer
showed a ﬂuctuation of 8.2 to 11.7 Å at residue numbers 20−
29, while the ﬂuctuation at the same position in δε was 8.6 to
10.8 Å. Furthermore, residues 15−16, 20−27, and 29 displayed
ﬂuctuation values ranging from 10.9 to 11.8 Å, 8.6 to 11.3 Å,
and 10.3 Å in the εδ tautomeric isomer, whereas the εε helical
region (residues 21−26) exhibited RMSF values of 9.1 to 9.8
Å. These results suggest that histidine tautomerization may
aﬀect the ﬂexibility and the self-association of huPrP. Overall,
the α-helix region in the εε isomer was less mobile and diﬃcult
to misfold compared with the other three isomers, which

map, and clustering studies.
H-bonds can exert pronounced eﬀects on peptide folding,
stabilization, and generation of accumulates.80 As PrP
ﬁbrilization is initiated by protein−protein interaction, it is
necessary to interpret the residual H-bond formation.81 In this
work, the H-bond interactions of H140 and H155 were
determined to analyze the function of these two His amino
acids in each PrP isomer (Table S1). The number of H-
bonding populations was dissimilar in all PrP isomeric forms,
highlighting that His tautomerism can aﬀect ﬁbrilization as well
as structural features of the monomeric PrP. H16 interacts with
serine 19 (S19) in εε/εδ isomers (contents of 19.01% and
4.06%, respectively) and I14 in εε (content: 10.42%).
However, in accordance with other MD/theoretical studies,
we also observed a connection between proline13 (P13) and
H16 as well as R12 and H16 in all isomers with diverse
populations.51 Additionally, H31 formed H-bonds with R27
and glutamate 28 (E28) within the δδ, δε, and εδ isomers. The
latter was also obtained in εε with a value of 3.88%.
Furthermore, εε, εδ, and δε showed H31:N29 (content:
3.11%); H31:R32 (content: 8.35%); H31:I14 (content:
3.23%) (εε), H31:N29 (content: 4.47%); H31:R32 (content:
2.83%) (εδ), and H31:R32 (content: 3.8%); H31: Y26
(content: 3.23%) (δε) H-bonds, respectively. Interestingly,
H31 links with itself in εδ and δδ tautomeric states (values:
2.34% and 2.98%, accordingly). In addition, associations
between H16 and H16 were also identiﬁed in all isomeric
forms with diﬀerent probabilities. As α-helices are formed and
stabilized by noncovalent interactions, mainly H-bonds;82,83
the H-bond [H16:H16; content: 0.37%] in the most toxic εδ
isomer may stabilize the α-helix (I15−H16) and contribute to
the accumulation of PrP monomer.
Generally, peptides that accumulate into ﬁbrillar structures
are disordered or have disordered domains. Thus, a detailed
interpretation of the misfolding process starts with an
understanding of the monomeric protein free energy landscape
(FEL).47 The 3D FELs of all PrP isomers were created using
dihedral principal component analysis (dPCA) by Carma
software to gain an overall view of the structural distributions
of each isomer.84,85 As can be seen in Figure 7, the FEL was
diﬀerent for each isomer. However, the δδ, εε, δε, and εδ
tautomeric isomers include 3, 2, 5, and 9 potential key wells,
showing that His tautomerism can aﬀect the local con-
formation of the PrP monomer. The presence of several
dominant wells in the δδ, δε, and εδ isomers signiﬁed multiple
energy minima in their FEL. The energy barriers among these
minima were relatively low, suggesting that conformational
transformation can happen easily between diverse structures.
These outcomes demonstrate that these three systems failed to
obtain a dominant conformation, and all of them showed
structural diversity. In contrast , we found a distinct global
energy minimum in εε, which suggests that εε has the highest
ratio of the most abundant structural state than δδ, εδ, and δε.
Overall, dPCA analysis supported our clustering results very
well. Altogether, multiple and wider local minima accounted
for the high helical formation in δδ, δε, and εδ than εε.
On the whole, our ﬁnding that all isomers of PrP (125−160)
contain more α-helix than β-sheet components, is in agreement
with previous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular
dichroism (CD) experimental results of the PrP protein. We
found no evidence in the monomeric sequence for any intrinsic
conformational preference for the formation of strong β-strand
interaction.86 Consistent with several studies, residues D20−
N29 in the δδ and δε; Y21−Y26 in the εε; and I15−H16,
D20−R27, and N29 in the εδ isomers formed α-helix with
higher probabilities compared with other amino acids in each
tautomeric isomer.60−63 Daggett and colleagues reported the
interrelation between His state and the mobility of the α-helix
in PrP.87 From RMSF analysis, we observed diﬀerent
ﬂuctuation values of the α-helices in all possible combinations
of the H140 and H155 isomeric forms, indicating His
tautomerism may aﬀect the residual mobility of PrP monomer.
On the basis of our results, all isomers exhibited H-bond
association between P13 and H16 as well as R12 and H16 with
diﬀerent probabilities, which is in line with earlier MD

3208studies.51 Furthermore, the existence of diverse types and
numbers of H-bonding (Table S1) in PrP isomeric forms
supports previous experimental studies that indicate that
tautomeric equilibria among Nε2-H (ε) and Nδ1-H (δ)
inﬂuence the peptide’s H-bond status.88−91 Altogether, our
results are in very good agreement with the available
theoretical and experimental information regarding the PrP
monomer.
The His tautomerism phenomena on early stages of PrP
misfolding which may aﬀects conformational transition of
monomeric PrP into an infectious accumulated state was
analyzed in this work. Our approach explains for the ﬁrst time
the modulation of PrP aggregation by neutral histidine
tautomeric states, highlighting the importance of His
tautomerization in disease pathogenesis. Extensive eﬀort has
been made to design potential antiprion therapeutic com-
pounds. However, no vaccine or prophylactic drugs or disease
reversing therapeutic strategies have discovered thus far,
although there are some compounds which block disease
progression, such as polyene antibiotics, polyanionic, tricyclic
compounds, tetracyclins, Congo red, and β-sheet breaker
proteins. Furthermore, immuno-based approaches, aimed at
disrupting the PrPC−PrPSc connection, have emerged as other
signiﬁcant therapeutic strategies against prion pathologies.92
However, it is necessary to ﬁnd novel, safe, and eﬀective agents
for human prion disorders. Considering that tautomerization is
a fundamental characteristic of the free neutral His state, the εδ
and δδ isomeric conformations with dominant α-helix content
could promote the aggregation pathway. As neuron dysfunc-
tion and death are caused by the neurotoxicity of a particular
misfolded state of PrP, targeting toxic PrP conformers (such as
εδ and δδ) may oﬀer strong therapeutic approaches to these
disorders. Overall, we tried to introduce some novel
molecularly deﬁned models for PrP-mediated neurotoxicity
that may herald a new era in the understanding of the
mechanism of PrPC to PrPSc conversion and PrP-related brain
degeneration.
■CONCLUSION
In conclusion, atomistic simulations were conducted to
examine organizational features of the PrP (125−160)
monomer under the His tautomerism eﬀect. In this work, we
only concentrated on equilibrium tautomeric forms. Simu-
lation outcomes revealed that diﬀerent conformational and
misfolding properties were obtained in the diﬀerent tautomeric
isomers of PrP. The toxic δδ and εδ isomer had the highest α-
helical content (21.01% and 21.11%), indicating these may be
easier to accumulate than other isomeric states. On the other
hand, εε and δε tautomeric isomers showed α-helix contents of
13.17 and 18.12%, respectively. The helix regions appeared as
thick streaks along the main diagonal in the isomers’ contact
maps. Using cluster and dPCA analysis, low populations of top
clusters with large conformational space was found to be an
essential feature of δδ, εδ, and δε. Additionally, we found a
distinct global energy minimum in εε. The total β-sheet
content of the δδ, εδ, δε, and εε isomers were 3.69, 3.01, 4.32,
and 4.11%, respectively, which agrees with previous ﬁndings
that monomeric PrP has few β-sheets. Lastly, RMSF and H-
bond analysis outcomes established that the tautomeric
features of His aﬀect intraisomer residual ﬂexibility and
interactions, which can inﬂuence the PrPC−PrPSc conforma-
tional transformation. Overall, we proposed the His tautomer-
ism hypothesis for PrP misfolding, which may help to design
proper drug molecules to control prionopathies.
■COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY
Currently, it is diﬃcult to achieve the amyloid structure of the
entire PrP with existing platforms, which can be attributed to
the accumulation-prone and intrinsic heterogeneity of
PrP.93−99 Earlier studies have shown that the 90−231 region
of the PrP protein, which corresponds to the protease K-
resistant fragment, can be converted into a variety of
oligomeric states.100−104 In this work, the fragment PrP125−
160, which is included in the PrP 90−231 region, was selected
as a simpliﬁed model to examine the accumulation character-
istics of the PrP monomer and the impact of His tautomerisms
on its accumulation. In addition, the PrP125−160 segment
also corresponds to another important fragment in the PrP
globular domain, which contains the highly accumulation-
prone fragment PrP127−147. Several reports have shown that
the segment PrP127−147 is a critical area for amyloidogenic
ﬁber generation in pathogenesis of GSS disease and related
encephalopathies, and it has also been documented to show
similar conformational properties to the whole of PrPSc (i.e.,
those related neurotoxicity and ﬁber formation).51,93 To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of tautomerism-mediated PrP
aggregation focused on its globular fragment. The extracted
atomic coordinate of PrP125−160 monomer from the NMR
structure (PDB: 1HJM) of huPrP at physiological pH, was
used as an input structure. Four PrP isomers were prepared by
residual replacement with the δ or ε tautomeric forms at
locations 140 and 155 of the monomeric sequence after
conformational reﬁnement using the 3Dreﬁne software.105 All
REMD simulations were conducted using the AMBER 14
suite. The AMBER ﬀ99SB force ﬁeld together with the implicit
generalized Born solvation model was adopted to describe the
protein and the solvent eﬀects.106,107 Implicit solvation, which
provides faster peptide sampling without water, signiﬁcantly
reduced the solvent viscosity and system size, and thus, it is
computationally inexpensive.108 There are a number of recent
studies that evaluate the applicability of the GB implicit solvent
REMD simulation in generating accurate information about
the protein conformational dynamics in peptide folding, which
also reveal that there is a perfect balance between accuracy and
speed.109 Several groups have already performed implicit
solvent-based REMD simulations on distinct PrP monomers to
analyze its misfolding and aggregation mechanisms.110−113
Furthermore, AMBER ﬀ99SB, which has been employed to
analyze the folding pathway of aggregation-prone peptides,
achieves an enhanced balance of crucial secondary structures,
like α-helices and sheets.114 A web server (http://folding.bmc.
uu.se/remd/) was utilized to assign the temperature
distributions of replicas. Based on the generated temperatures
from the server, 14 replicas were set up for the current
monomer sequence with temperatures ranging from 290 to
600 K. Initially, 2000 cycles of steepest descent and 2000
cycles of the conjugate gradient energy minimizations were
conducted to eliminate unnatural collisions. Then, 1 ns
conventional simulations were performed to equilibrate each
replica at its target temperature. Lastly, four REMD
simulations were performed for 800, 600, 800, and 600 ns
for εδ, δδ, εε, and δε tautomeric isomers with an exchange
interval of 2 ps. The time step was 2 fs with the SHAKE
algorithm used to constrain all bonds stretching freedom
including hydrogen. The cutoﬀ distance for the nonbonded

3209interactions was ﬁxed to inﬁnite. The replica temperature was
maintained using a Langevin thermostat with a collision
frequency of one per picosecond. The overall exchange rate
was 23−24%. The trajectory collected at 308.09 K was used for
further analysis.
